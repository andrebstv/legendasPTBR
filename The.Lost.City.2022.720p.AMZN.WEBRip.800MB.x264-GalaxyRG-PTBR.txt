1
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:52,405
You were incredible.

2
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,270
My heart is still racing.

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,480
I felt it too.

4
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,517
All thanks
to your brute strength, Dash,

5
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,761
and your knowledge
of ancient Aramaic mathematics.

6
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,764
Please. This has nothing to do
with my two doctorates

7
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,939
and my master's
in Gender Studies

8
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,805
and everything to do
with you, Dr. Lovemore.

9
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:15,152
The truth is,

10
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,637
I never thought I would find
the Lost City of D.

11
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,675
I would
choose your words carefully.

12
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,539
They will be your last.

13
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:26,405
You led me right
to King Kalaman's tomb

14
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:30,098
and his queen's
legendary Crown of Fire.

15
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:33,101
And now I will be very rich,

16
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,897
and you will be very dead.

17
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,212
Hold up. Are these--
Are these your snakes?

18
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:41,937
No, they were just here.

19
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,492
There were just
hundreds of snakes
in this temple

20
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:46,459
just waiting for us
to show up?

21
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,668
Who feeds them? You feed them?No, what do they eat?

22
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:50,981
Why is that one
not biting that guy?
Why is that happening?

23
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,949
-Are they trained not
to bite henchmen or something?
-Yeah, well...

24
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,331
I mean, the snake-to-temple
ratio alone...

25
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,885
This is ridiculous.
Delete.

26
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,061
I-- I think my character
can still work.

27
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,890
Delete.

28
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:06,169
Loretta, you still have
a story to write.

29
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,171
Delete.

30
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:12,416
Hey, it's me, Beth.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,936
I don't want to pull the whole
"I'm your publisher" card,
but I am.

32
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,387
And I'm really looking forward
to seeing this last chapter.

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,527
But no pressure.
No, there actually is pressure.

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,807
The exact amount of pressure
that motivates you
but doesn't paralyze you.

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,291
You got this.

36
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:27,811
Thank you.

37
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,951
Me again.

38
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,918
Okay, so everything
is set for the book tour,

39
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:34,852
but, uh, the only thing we need
is a book to tour with.

40
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:37,096
I can't help
but get the feeling that
you're not finishing

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,650
because you don't want
to leave your house.

42
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:44,931
Listen, I know these last
five years have been hard
after John's passing,

43
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:48,418
and it feels easier
to live in your bathtub,

44
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,179
drinking Chardonnay on ice.

45
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:54,078
But, girl,
there is a great big world
waiting for you

46
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:57,185
and a book tour
that I can't cancel, so just
make it happen, all right?

47
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,531
Love you, bye!

48
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,069
We have to keep going.

49
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:22,590
Let's see
what's on the other side
of that door.

50
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,799
But what if
there isn't anything?

51
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,629
There's only one way
to find out.

52
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:30,460
Then Lovemore realized

53
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,841
the treasure she wanted
was lost forever

54
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:35,327
and her adventures
were coming to an end.

55
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,569
That doesn't feel right.

56
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,468
Yeah, but that's it.

57
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:40,021
That's the end.

58
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,618
Well, John,

59
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,309
here I go.

60
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:54,691
Dulcius ex asperis.

61
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:03,976
Okay, honey, it's showtime.
-Are you sure about this?

62
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,669
Because I have a wedgie
in the back and in the front
in this thing.

63
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:10,016
I feel like
a nerdy figure skater.

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,812
Sexy. Stunner.
I'm all about it.No, it's not. It's not.

65
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,849
-How do I move in this?
-Don't touch it.

66
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:17,161
I'm not touching it.
I'm holding it out.Stop it. Will you stop?

67
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:19,440
Get it out now
'cause you can't do that
onstage.

68
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,235
And we're done.
And we're done. Okay, good.

69
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,237
Do I need to be wearing
a glitter onesie?

70
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,791
You only have to wear this
for two hours.

71
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,862
Do not mess this up,
do you hear me?
This is on loan.

72
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,967
Everyone's wearing
sequins right now.

73
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,557
Why is she taking my photo?This is Allison.

74
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,973
She is our new
social media manager.

75
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,907
And she's gonna be helping us
target that younger demographic.

76
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,496
Meaning women in their 30s
who wish they were in their 20s.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,118
Hey, what's up?

78
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:46,570
Um, I took over your socials,
so this morning you tweeted,

79
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:51,851
"Where are my ladies at?
Meet me at Ballroom G
at- 00 p.m.

80
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:53,405
#ShawnMendes.

81
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:56,373
#GaggingToMeetYouAll."

82
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:59,031
Okay, we are having fun.
Let's go.

83
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:02,103
We need to remind people
that you are still alive.

84
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,622
People know I'm alive.

85
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:05,693
And to remind them
why this used to be

86
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:07,867
the best selling franchise.In Romance.

87
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:10,594
Yes, which is the top
revenue-generating
literary category.

88
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:13,563
Revenue-generating
isn't how I would describe
our presales right now.

89
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,806
Just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth.

90
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,532
Oh, you want word of mouth?
Here we go. How's this?

91
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,432
"The only thing
more lost than the city
is the author herself."

92
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:22,295
"Loveless."
"Passionless."

93
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,299
Uh, "Way past her prime."
And, oh, "This is fake history
at its worst."

94
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:28,578
A book tour could
change everything, okay?

95
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,994
We have to remind the fans
why they love you so much.

96
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,687
Real history.
I merely season it
with a smidge more nudity.

97
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,000
History had
a ton of nudity.

98
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:39,934
Deep exploration.

99
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,523
Steamy wondering.

100
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:47,666
Will Lovemore and Dash find
Queen Taha's priceless
Crown of Fire?

101
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:49,564
Join them on their search.

102
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,601
So, listen, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

103
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:52,947
There's so many people.

104
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,190
I know how much you hate
doing these things,

105
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:58,021
so I've invited Alan
to do the Q and A
with you today.

106
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,126
-What?
-And the rest of the book tour.

107
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,198
Beth, I expressly asked
not to do any more events
with Dash-- Alan, Alan!

108
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:06,132
-He's gonna humiliate me.
-He's not gonna humiliate you.

109
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:09,273
Thank you.
You're very good at your job.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

110
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:10,585
Let me help you with that.

111
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,587
He is-- He's
a body wash commercial.

112
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,555
He's always glistening
all over the place.

113
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:17,558
There hasn't been an event
where his shirt
didn't come flying off.

114
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,180
You wish.
Well, he's already here,

115
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:21,424
so put on your big-girl panties
and let's get out there.

116
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:24,703
Remember,
no grumpy face, big words
or boring academic talk.

117
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:28,085
Yes! Yes!

118
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,122
Come on, RTP!

119
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,710
Ha-ha!

120
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:34,057
Yes, my Lovemore-heads!

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,612
I am so excited
to introduce to you

122
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:41,547
the award-winning author,
Loretta Sage!

123
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,205
Beth, I can't do this.
I'm not ready.Are you kidding me?

124
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,034
Listen, I've got your back.
You got this.

125
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,657
Go give the people
what they want.

126
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,624
It's not me they want.Get out there now!

127
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,010
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you. Thank you.

128
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,086
Yep. Mount it.

129
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,436
Mount it. Mount it.
Okay.

130
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,231
Find your center.

131
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:13,890
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

132
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,754
The sexiest...
All right!

133
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:19,861
...most influential hero
of a generation.

134
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,173
That's a bit strong.

135
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,900
His 20th cover
of an Angela Lovemore novel.

136
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,627
Dash McMahon!

137
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,600
Oh, my God! Dash!

138
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,625
Take a bow.I already did mine.
I did mine.

139
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,697
Okay, come on.
One more. I got you.

140
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:19,369
Did you guys rehearse that?
Oh, my God.

141
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:23,304
I'm loving this chemistry
between you two,
and I got to say,

142
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:25,548
I love this book.

143
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:26,721
Oh, thank you, Ray.Thank--

144
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:28,171
Spoiler alert.

145
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,552
A really bold choice

146
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,588
to not have them go
into the tomb at the end.

147
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,314
Talk about
what went into this one.

148
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,869
I mean, this one's
such a special book
for me personally.

149
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:39,803
I-- I don't know how to say
how much it means to me

150
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:42,012
that Loretta,
word writer extraordinaire,

151
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:45,153
has, you know,
named the book after me.

152
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,086
The Lost City of Dash.

153
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,294
The Lost City of D.

154
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,642
Um, but that's not what
the D stands for.

155
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,334
It's D for "dick," right?No dick, no.

156
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:56,544
It's based on the name
of an ancient tribe,
Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica.

157
00:08:56,648 --> 00:09:01,204
And, um, it was too difficult
for the European colonizers
to pronounce,

158
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,587
so, in true colonial fashion
they abbreviated it.No one cares about this.

159
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,416
That's so interesting.
Okay.

160
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,832
How about we
take some questions
from the audience?

161
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:10,731
Right here, handsome!Yes.

162
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:14,976
Dash, what's your favorite
romantic moment?Ooh.

163
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,602
What I would really like
to know is what is Loretta's
favorite romantic moment?

164
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,638
Ooh, spicy.

165
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:23,675
Oh, uh...

166
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:26,470
-Well, being a sapiosexual--

167
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:28,783
Oh, is that when
they do the snakes
around the...

168
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:32,960
No. That's someone
who finds, uh, intellect

169
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:36,964
or intelligence,
uh, very sexy, you know.

170
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,172
Same.

171
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:39,898
Really?

172
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:42,417
Dash! Rip off your shirt!

173
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:46,249
No, no, no.
We're not gonna do that today.
We're here for Loretta's book.

174
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,216
Do we have questions
for Loretta?

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,497
Uh, yes,
studious-looking young lady?
What would you like to ask me?

176
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,638
Can you rip off Dash's shirt?

177
00:09:57,191 --> 00:10:00,021
No, no. We're not gonna
do this again. Sorry.

178
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,645
Rip it off! Rip it off!

179
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:05,061
Rip it off! Rip it off!
Rip it off!

180
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:08,892
Of course. Of course, yes.
Can do.

181
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,136
Is this happening?

182
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,965
You don't have to do this.Oh, we have to.

183
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,140
We have to give the people
what they want. Yes, yes.

184
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:17,970
We have to give the people
what they want, yes.

185
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:21,318
Ladies and gentlemen,
enjoy.

186
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:26,082
Because The Lost City of D
is Dash's final adventure.

187
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,256
If there even
is a next book,

188
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,466
it will open with Lovemore
receiving the tragic news

189
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,917
of his untimely death.

190
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,401
What?

191
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,955
Shit. I'm sorry.
My smartwatch is stuck.Ow. Hold on.

192
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:38,128
I know. Don't pull it.

193
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,751
It's okay. Just be real still.

194
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,269
No. That's pulling it.You're pulling it.

195
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,962
You're gonna rip my wig off.
No, you can't--

196
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,346
Oh, my!

197
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,865
Oh, my God.Is he okay?

198
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,591
God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,352
-I'm so sorry.
You're a bad person.

200
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:59,702
Stick around
for the costume contest
at- 00 p.m.

201
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:02,808
"If there is another book"?

202
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:07,813
I'm investing
everything we've got
into this tour, okay?

203
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,368
I just don't think I have
another Dash and Lovemore
adventure in me.

204
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:12,853
How does Dash die?

205
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,096
Was it the snakes?No.

206
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,547
Okay, so I have something
that I have to take care of.

207
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,101
You guys have an interview
in the next suite
in ten minutes.

208
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,621
So can you please do me a favor
and be grown-ups

209
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,243
and get yourselves there
on your own?

210
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:25,555
Okay. Thank you so much.

211
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:28,420
Does he die from
a staph infection?

212
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,458
It is a staph infection.
I knew it.

213
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,013
I-I-- All right.

214
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:38,188
Look, I get it
if you need a break
or something,

215
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,294
but you can't
just kill me, okay?Okay.

216
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:44,781
I hate that I have to
ask this, but you do know
you're not Dash, right?

217
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:47,059
Dash is a character
I made up.

218
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,405
Dash?

219
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,478
Thanks.

220
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:53,790
Thank you.

221
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,553
Loretta, it's this way.No, I think it's this way.

222
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:01,004
Can't you see that Dash
means so much to people?

223
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,972
Means so much to you.Not to me.

224
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:04,732
Well, yeah, to me,
but to other people too.

225
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,804
What about Beth?You know what?
Beth is gonna be fine.

226
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:11,739
She's gonna find plenty
fresh, young writers
full of great ideas.

227
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,845
You can transition gracefully

228
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:16,295
into the shirt-on phase
of your modeling career,

229
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,745
and I can be left alone.

230
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,574
Everybody is happy.

231
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,473
No, it's this way.

232
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,406
Beth says you don't even
leave the house anymore.

233
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,546
I don't feel like
that's very happy.

234
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,549
You should be going out in
the world, filling yourself up
on new experiences.

235
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,896
I'm already filled up.
I'm full. I'm fully satiated.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,348
Why would you want
to be stuck at home alone
when you could see the world?

237
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,970
You could be visiting
ancient Greece.

238
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,973
Okay. How could I visit
ancient Greece?

239
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:41,113
I get it. Because
you're afraid of flying.

240
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:44,634
No. Because ancient Greece
is in the past.

241
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,291
Just like Dash.

242
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:49,604
Okay. You want to know who else
is stuck in the past? You are.

243
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,469
You're so afraid
of life hurting you again
that you've stopped living.

244
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,886
You're like a human mummy.

245
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,406
I didn't, um...

246
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:00,857
Oh.

247
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:03,101
Mummies are human.

248
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:14,353
Stupid-- Oh, crap.

249
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,391
I'm so sorry.
I-I will clean this up.

250
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,980
I am not a litterer,
I-I assure you that.

251
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,569
Do you, um--
Do you think you could, uh,
call a car for me, please?

252
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:25,192
Thank you. Thank you.

253
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:29,127
Bring the car around.

254
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,680
God, is that
someone's retainer?

255
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:33,131
I've never said the right thing
one time around her.

256
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,167
I get nervous
because she opens her mouth,

257
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:39,723
and just an encyclopedia
of beautifulness comes out,
and I just never say--

258
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,139
You know
she's trying to kill me?

259
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,417
I just need
those tomatoes.

260
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,868
You're right.
No, you're right.

261
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,455
I should apologize.
Thank you, man.

262
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,802
I appreciate that
very, very much.You're welcome.

263
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,229
Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah.

264
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:08,545
Uh--

265
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,065
Hiya.

266
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:12,653
Uh, I did not order
an UberPool.

267
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:15,725
Someone wants to meet you.
We'll have you right back.

268
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:17,002
Um...

269
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,765
Loretta!

270
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:23,388
Loretta! Loretta?

271
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,151
Uh, Loretta?

272
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,843
Did you say "Loretta"?Yeah.

273
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:32,155
Follow that SUV, man.No.

274
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,019
Come on, please!No, no, no.

275
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,195
I'm not helping
any more handsome strangers.
Fool me once. Mm-mmm.

276
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:40,612
What is this, Taken?
Am I "tooken"?

277
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:42,131
Am I sold already?

278
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,237
Am I--
Am I sold to him?

279
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:49,000
Ow. Stop.Oh, no. Did this feel creepy?

280
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,726
I said
don't make it creepy, guys.

281
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,659
I'm so sorry
about the setting.

282
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,352
I just flew in.
I was in a real panic
to meet you.

283
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:58,526
I didn't have time
to dress the place up much.

284
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,426
I read you love cheese,
so I just got them all.

285
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,602
Are you the one
who's been emailing me
for photos of my feet?

286
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,570
No. Um--

287
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,988
And I promise
what I'm about to show you
is gonna make you very happy.

288
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:13,956
But first, a little bit

289
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,269
about the mysterious rogue
you see before you.

290
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:19,651
Uh, my name
is Abigail Fairfax.

291
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,688
Abigail?It's a gender-neutral name,
like Leslie or Beverly.

292
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:26,485
Yes, but you're Abigail Fairfax
of the media-mogul Fairfaxes?

293
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:30,627
Didn't you just
take over your company or...

294
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:34,666
No, that was my brother,
actually. That was Leslie.
We're all very proud.

295
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,876
Ah. Yes, I should say so,
at such a young age to--

296
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,912
Some might even say
too young.

297
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:42,743
But that world
never really interested me.

298
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:45,435
My passions, as you may know,

299
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:48,645
lie in the hidden things
in the world,

300
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,372
things which defy possession.

301
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:54,513
Um, some might call me
a collector.

302
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:58,310
But there is one obsession
in particular

303
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:00,519
that has held me captive.

304
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:03,177
The Crown of Fire

305
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,662
and its cascading
red diamonds.

306
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:09,425
Is this a... Is this
a hidden-camera thing?

307
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:13,118
So imagine my surprise
when, in your new book,

308
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,501
amidst the pages
of coital reverie,

309
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:17,433
was something...

310
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,607
Oh, God....quite magnificent.

311
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:24,026
I get it. I get it.
I so get it right now.

312
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,441
Oh, my gosh.

313
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:27,719
I literally thought
you guys kidnapped me.

314
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,308
I mean,
this is marketing, right?
Beth set this up?

315
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,311
This was so good, you guys.
This was amazing.

316
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,659
You, with your gun
and your mustache

317
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,731
and your,
"You'd better get in there"
and you know...

318
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,458
Oh, my God.

319
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:46,324
You, with the G.I. Joe
tone-on-tone outfit.

320
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:51,432
Your fictional archaeologist
was making real translations
of a dead language.

321
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:54,435
Mm-hmm.Something nobody else
has been able to do.

322
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,955
Well, nobody else
had ever tried.

323
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,888
Is that right?
Am I saying the right thing?

324
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,648
Except you, right?

325
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:02,719
Except me!

326
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,549
Yes. See, it turns out

327
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,966
Loretta Sage
was once a young college girl
doing her dissertation

328
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,934
on the dead language of the D
with her future husband,

329
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,145
dreaming
of finding Kalaman's tomb
and the Crown of Fire.

330
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:17,355
I was sorry to read
you gave up your search
after he died.

331
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,081
But what that means is,

332
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,256
you're all I have left.

333
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,535
All-All you have left
for... what?

334
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,674
Hmm.

335
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:29,712
Oh.

336
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,196
Here we go.

337
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,039
What is this?

338
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:50,836
I believe it is describing
the exact location
of Kalaman's tomb,

339
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,392
in which Taha
and her priceless headdress
are buried.

340
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,635
Well, if this were authentic,

341
00:17:56,739 --> 00:18:02,089
you would still have to
uncover an entire city

342
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:05,230
that nobody
has been able to find.

343
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,990
I found it.

344
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:10,235
On a tiny, forgotten island
in the Atlantic
called Isla Hundida.

345
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,894
What I have not been
able to find is Kalaman's
final resting place.

346
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:18,278
This piece of parchment
is the only clue we found
among the ruins.

347
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:21,522
I need someone
who can decipher these symbols.

348
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,697
I need you.

349
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,286
Well...Miss Sage,

350
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:29,772
surely this isn't how
you want your story to end.

351
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,464
We both had our dreams crushed
by bad luck,

352
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,811
or in my case,
an arse-kissing little brother,

353
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:38,021
but this is our chance
to show them all.

354
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,713
Come with me...
to the island.

355
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:44,959
Translate these symbols
and help me find
the Crown of Fire.

356
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,686
You can name your price.

357
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,140
I must respectfully decline.

358
00:18:58,007 --> 00:18:59,215
Well...

359
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,805
I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

360
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,188
But I understand
how you feel.

361
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,296
Will you at least let us
give you a ride?

362
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,680
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll call for my own car,
and I'll just...

363
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:41,015
I don't feel like
you're listening to me.
This is urgent, and we--

364
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,053
Okay, so the police are saying
that they put out an APB...

365
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,813
APB....on an SUV,

366
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,160
and there's
this 24-hour rule...Why is there a rule?

367
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:50,680
...and they won't
do anything until...What about the FBI or the CIA?

368
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,751
-They said to call the police.
-I'm sure Loretta's fine.

369
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,444
When I was in college,
my friend Nicki went missing.

370
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,169
Everyone was, like,
freaking out.

371
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,620
But then she was just
in her car.

372
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:02,899
She was dead, but we found her.
She wasn't gone.

373
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:07,352
Um, what about...
Maybe we could get a PI

374
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,975
or, like, you know,
private security or--

375
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,977
What about an extraction team,
like the movie?

376
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,566
Yes! But who does that?
The ex-military, right?

377
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,259
Oh, yeah. I think
I actually have somebody
that could help us.

378
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:20,331
-Oh.
-I did this meditation retreat,

379
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,505
and there was this
trainer guy there.

380
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,127
You should
see this guy meditate.

381
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:25,646
But he's ex-Navy SEAL.

382
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,547
He-- He's a special ops trainer.
What was his name?

383
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:31,376
Yeah. Jack Trainer.

384
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,102
So he's a trainer
named Jack Trainer?

385
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,380
That's how I have
everybody in my phone.
See, "Janice Mom."

386
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,933
"Larry Doorknob."
"Stacy Butt Stuff."

387
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,729
Look, this is
what this guy does.
He finds people.

388
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,111
If there's anybody
that can help us, it's him.

389
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,569
Jack Trainer.Oh, so his name
is actually Jack Trainer.

390
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:55,573
Hi, uh, this is Alan
from "Touching Your Inner Self."

391
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,886
The meditation retreat?

392
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:03,684
Anyway, uh, okay.
Our friend Loretta
has been kidnapped,

393
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,237
and no one's helping us.

394
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:06,825
How long she been missing?

395
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,171
Maybe two hours now.

396
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,587
Who is that?

397
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,729
Um, this is B--
This is Beth. I'm Beth.

398
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:16,248
And Allison
is on too, sir.

399
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:18,561
Did she have any
Wi-Fi-enabled devices?

400
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,564
-She's got her phone, right?
-No, I have her phone.

401
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:24,291
Oh! She has a smartwatch.
It ripped my wig off.

402
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:27,329
What was that scenario?
Never mind. Open the phone.

403
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:28,985
Go to the smartwatch app.All right.

404
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,402
Then hit "Find My Smartwatch."

405
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:34,439
Oh, my... That is so good.
That's why we called.

406
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,993
"Anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy."

407
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,790
Is that Oprah or Deepak? Laozi fromTao-te Ching.

408
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:42,102
Oh, my God.

409
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,897
It's in the Atlantic.

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,348
She's on a plane?
How can you tell that?

411
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,626
'Cause she can't swim
that fast.

412
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,179
Doesn't sound like
a ransom scenario.

413
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,906
My guess is blood sport,
Hunger Games type situation.

414
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:55,840
Possibly some coke-fueled
dark web scavenger hunt.

415
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,980
Real clown shit.
We'll have to move fast.

416
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,017
-How do we pay you?
-Cryptocurrency. Cash App.

417
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:04,607
I'll have her back
within 48 hours
or your next rescue is free.

418
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:06,195
How many people
need a next rescue?

419
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:07,817
More than you'd think.

420
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,750
-I'm gonna need that phone.
-I'll bring it to you.

421
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:12,615
Let me know where she lands.
I'll meet you there, Alan.

422
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:28,666
Hello.

423
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:34,396
Where am I?

424
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:36,501
Um, you're on my plane.

425
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,813
It's nice, isn't it? Hmm?

426
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,746
The seats are made of
mama llama leather.

427
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:42,956
Well, I'm getting off
your plane.

428
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,440
Unchain me!

429
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:46,097
That's your seat belt.

430
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,548
Did you chloroform me?

431
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,860
People actually do that?

432
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,900
Well, you know,
it's a classic for a reason.

433
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,833
My body feels drunk.

434
00:22:57,936 --> 00:22:59,835
It'll wear off in a bit.
I am sorry.

435
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:02,354
I just couldn't wait around
for you to change your mind.

436
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,909
Stop playing jelly.Time is not on our side.

437
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:07,739
You see, the volcano
we're excavating around

438
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,810
has developed
a bad case of indigestion.

439
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,778
I'm rather worried
that when it blows,

440
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,952
everything that's left
of the Lost City
will be destroyed.

441
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,954
Oh, my God.
My legs don't work.

442
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:21,477
So, this is our last chance
to find both the tomb
and the crown.

443
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,617
Oh, God. Oh!

444
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,999
Don't worry.
That's just our final descent.

445
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:32,108
But it is the beginning
of the greatest adventure
of your life.

446
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,800
Welcome to the Lost City.

447
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,845
How did you find it?

448
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,089
So, the city was built
on a lava dome.

449
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:58,885
As the volcano became active,
the dome filled with lava,

450
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:01,612
and sunken things
rose to the surface.

451
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,614
The D exposed itself.

452
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:06,755
-The entire city?
-No, no. Just the tip.

453
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:10,068
As soon as I heard rumors
of the ruins, I flew over
and bought the place.

454
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:13,451
The site?No. The island.
The southern half.

455
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,902
I got a good deal
'cause this is where
the lava flows.

456
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:18,249
We've been excavating
for a year now.

457
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,873
One doesn't kidnap
a romance novelist
on day one.

458
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:24,013
Ah, yes, as the saying goes.

459
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:27,120
Rafi doesn't like it.
Do you, Rafi?

460
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:30,399
He says
we're disrespecting
his heritage.

461
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:33,747
But not a lot of other
job options on the island,
are there, Rafi?

462
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:35,922
Beggars can't be choosers.

463
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,589
No more charcuterie,
I take it.

464
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:49,798
Mmm. Please.
I'm not a monster.

465
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,731
Whatever you need, just shout.

466
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:58,116
Uh, leave one hand free.
She has some translating to do.

467
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,567
And then what?

468
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:03,190
Loretta, I really wish
you would try and see

469
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:05,434
what an exciting opportunity
this is for us.

470
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:09,438
I believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb.

471
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:12,061
It's a logographic system.

472
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,409
Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics.

473
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:19,310
Now, if you have other documents
that possibly I can compare--

474
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,691
Yeah, no luck there.

475
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:23,590
We found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall,

476
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:24,591
but it was useless.

477
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,248
Just pictures of women.

478
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,942
Look, I, too, wish
your dear old dead
archaeologist husband

479
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,773
was here to help,
but he's not, so,

480
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:36,983
time to shine, Loretta,
sex-book writer.

481
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,124
They will come for me.

482
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:42,436
Who, exactly?

483
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,266
Your-- Your many cats?

484
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,164
Oh, I don't have cats.

485
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,580
Somehow even more sad.

486
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:51,653
I have a hamster, asshole!

487
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:53,413
You have a hamster's asshole?

488
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:57,279
No, there was a--
there was a comma between--
Forget it.

489
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,800
I bet your brother never had
to kidnap anyone!

490
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:35,800
♪ From the dusty mesa♪

491
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:40,218
♪ Her looming shadow grows♪

492
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:43,705
♪ Hidden in the branches♪

494
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,128
Good to see you, man.

495
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,854
Phone.Right.

496
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,970
What?

497
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,662
Yeah, I was thinking
that I could, you know,

498
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,354
maybe just sort of
come with you.

499
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,218
Why?To help.

500
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:18,463
I know CPR.
I know some light karate.
CrossFit certified.

501
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,086
Okay, okay, listen, listen!

502
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,640
I just-- It's my fault.

503
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,849
Not the kidnapping
and stuff,

504
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,025
but, like, I said
some really mean stuff to her,
and I regret it,

505
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:29,751
and I just need
to take it back.

506
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:31,235
I called her a human mummy.

507
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:33,996
Mummies are human.

508
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:37,068
I'm aware of that now, yes.

509
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:40,209
That is true.

510
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:41,314
Please.

511
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:45,283
All right, Alan,
I can't be responsible
for you.

512
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,251
Okay. Yeah.

513
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:50,323
I need you
to stay in the car.Yeah.

514
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:52,532
In the car.In the car.

515
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:55,086
The whole time.The whole time?

516
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,432
Whole time.

517
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:57,779
Mm-hmm.

518
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,816
Yes!

519
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,100
This is me.

520
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,276
Really? Is this what
the SEAL teams use?

521
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:15,037
"Only a fool chooses a horse
by its color."

522
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:17,937
Right, right.
The Tao-te Ching?

523
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,181
No, it was on the sign
back there at the rental place.

I was hoping to invite you
to breakfast,

"rest" or "resting."

539

So it would be,
"Kalaman and his treasure..."

540

And then
there are some missing pieces,

547
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:49,062
My God,
this shouldn't be this hard!

548
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,099
It is not some pauper's grave
we're looking for.

It is a monument to a great man!

550
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:55,517
King Kalaman was ambitious,
he was powerful,

551
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,071
he was the first man
to build a city
in the Atlantic.

552
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,832
The eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him.

553
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:04,181
He would have had a pyramid,
a ziggurat, a tower

554
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:06,252
to hold his Crown of Fire.

555
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:09,255
All I need to know
is where it is.

556
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:12,603
I don't know if you recall,
but you only said translate it.

557
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,846
I-I translated it.

558
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,228
Translate it again.

559
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:25,892
One day, we're gonna
laugh about this.

560
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:28,136
Such an adventure
we're having.

561
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:35,591
I should go with you,
just for backup and awesomeness.

562
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:38,215
This is pretty awesome.

563
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,976
You got nature, the radio.

564
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:45,739
Yeah, you're right,
but it's very, very important
to me

565
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:47,707
that she knows
that I came to rescue her.

566
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,502
Why?
Do you like this woman?

567
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,712
No, I just brought snacks
and stuff.

568
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:54,990
And she gets a little grumpy
when she's hungry.

569
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:58,511
Blood pressure drops.
And I get that because I'm
a five-meal-a-day kind of guy.

570
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:01,410

You look like you keto.

571
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:03,205
No.No. Yeah.

572
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:05,035
You don't need it.

00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:06,622
What is it?

574
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:10,316

577
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,948
and I just go,
"Shh. You're safe now"?

578
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:25,020
Sure, champ.
She'll love that.

00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:48,895
-Why would you throw a gun?
-Seriously?

671
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,106
Get me out of the chair.I can't. We don't have time.

672
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:58,733
Gotta squeeze!
You got to do a Kegel
or something!

673
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:01,218
-Kegel it!
-What do you think a Kegel is?

674
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,703
I'm not in it, not in!
Still not in!

675
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:06,188
-You got to go in more.
-Stop. Stop. Stop it!

676
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:08,294
Oh, oh, oh!

677
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:11,918
Oh, God. Get in the car,
get in the car!
Start the car! Start the car!

678
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:13,299
-Go, go.
-Move your leg.

679
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,715
Which one?Both of them! Move them!

680
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:21,445
Forward, forward!Okay. Okay.

681
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,863
-I'm going! I'm going! Okay!
-Drive!

682
00:38:27,002 --> 00:38:30,627
Shh. You're safe now. Shh.

683
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,664
Ow.

684
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:35,908
Shh. You're safe now.No, I'm not. Not safe.

685
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:37,772
Oh, no, am I bleeding?

686
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,878
-I don't think that's yours.
-Oh, no, that's a lot of blood.

687
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,019
Cheese and rice!

688
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:45,607
Are those his brains?What?

689
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:47,678
I think his brains
are on my face!

690
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:51,406
Definitely his brains
are in my mouth.
I can taste his thoughts!

691
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,718
Focus on the road.

692
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:54,961
He just liked
training people. Trainer.

693
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:57,930
-What are you talking about?
-He loved me.

694
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:00,622
Can you just scooch the car
over to the left?

695
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:04,454
Get it off. Get it off.Oh, God.

696
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:05,834
Watch out!

697
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,945
Oh! Oh! Oh!

698
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:16,949
Oh, did you see...

699
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:20,953
No.

700
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:27,684
Oh.

701
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,446
Oh, no. Oh, no.

702
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:33,483
Oh, no.

703
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:43,458
Oh, no.

704
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:49,637
Oh, holy Christmas.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

705
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,811
Do you think you could
get me out of here?

706
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,468
Yeah. Okay.

707
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:56,471
You just flew out of the car.I did. I did, indeed.

708
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:58,024
Okay. I got you.
I got you.

709
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:00,579
Can you get me out of the chair?
Get me out of the chair.

710
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:02,512
You're right.
You're right. You're right.

711
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:05,687
Is that--
Is that a nail filer?Yeah.

712
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,275
Can you just rip it?It's working.

713
00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:09,173
And maybe next time
I toss a gun at you,

714
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:11,175
you can catch it
instead of ducking.

715
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:14,489
How about the next time
you toss a gun at me,
you say, "Hey, Alan, catch"?

716
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:16,457
Then maybe do that
before you throw it?

717
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,666
Well, "here"
is a synonym for "catch."

718
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:20,288
No, "here" is not a cinnamon
for "catch."

719
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:22,463
In a colloquial kind of way,
yes, it is.

720
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:24,672
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a sweatshirt.

721
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:26,777
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a pen.

722
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:29,953
How 'bout just,
"Hey! Catch! Gun!"

723
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:33,059
Anything that you want
to throw, I'll catch it
because you said, "Catch."

724
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,923
And I'll catch it
because you said it.

725
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:37,443
That is also an option,
and then we would have a gun
with us.

726
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:38,651
That's a thing.

727
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:41,033
Be careful.Okay, we need to call--

728
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:42,793
Be careful.

729
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:45,416
We need to call for help,
get to the airport
and get out of here.

730
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,522
And I am driving.Okay.

731
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:52,596
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

732
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,712
Okay, call for--
call for help.

733
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,610
Where's your phone?

734
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:11,028
Okay.

735
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:17,483
-Tell me you caught them.
-I tagged the blond one.

736
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,970
Oh, Loretta.

737
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:24,145
What are you thinking?

738
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,355
You might've killed one of them,
but his partner's
still with her.

739
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:31,117
And he is clearly skilled,
highly trained

740
00:41:32,118 --> 00:41:33,775
and very dangerous.

741
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:47,651
So, Miss Sage said
she was gonna leave the event,

742
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:52,414
then got in a car
and left the event?

743
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:55,210
-Did you try calling her?
-She doesn't have her phone.

744
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:56,729
Stolen phone.Didn't say that.

745
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,593
Where's my magnifier?

746
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,699
Listen, can you please
help with Nana?

747
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:03,184
I don't want her
hearing about Loretta
'cause it's going to upset her.

748
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,359
-What about Loretta?
-Nothing, Nana.
She just went on a trip.

749
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,740
Yeah.

750
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:10,294
That girl needed
to get out of the house.

751
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:14,575
So, this is the thing.
Loretta's phone is not stolen.
I took it.

752
00:42:14,678 --> 00:42:19,131
I gave it to Alan.
Alan then gave it to
the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer.

753
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:21,512
And that is how we found
her wearable.

754
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:23,307
And who's Alan?Dash.

755
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:26,241
-What's that?
-He's the hero
in all of her books.

756
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:29,382
-Nana. Hey, slut.
-Mm-mmm.

757
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,420
Let's go in the other room
and talk about whichever war
you lived through.

758
00:42:32,523 --> 00:42:35,665
Okay. Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm sorry. It'll be fun.

759
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:37,701
Listen,
Loretta Sage is missing.

760
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,014
When I looked at her smartwatch,
it said that she had flown

761
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,774
to some island
I've never even heard about.

762
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:43,604
That means y'all need
to do something about this.

763
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:46,089
And if you can't, I will,
and that won't look good
for you.

764
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:48,919
Pretty sure that's
outside our jurisdiction.

765
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:52,060
-You'd have to call the Feds.
-Okay.

766
00:42:52,164 --> 00:42:54,545
And if you do go to the Feds,
put in a good word for me.

767
00:42:54,649 --> 00:42:57,031
For me.For us.

768
00:43:02,657 --> 00:43:04,176
Oh, oh.

769
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:13,461
What are you gonna do,
put the car back together?

770
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:15,774
Well... we could--

771
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:34,378
Where did you say the phone was?Passenger glove.

772
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:36,242
What?Passenger glove compartment.

773
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:37,588
Goodness.

774
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:40,212
Oh, my God.

775
00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:42,559
Oh, my God. No phone, no car.
We're so gonna die out--

776
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:44,388
Here.What is this?

777
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,149
Boots for the jungle.

778
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:48,841
It's not exactly
hiking boots, but...

779
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:51,602
I figured your feet
would be killing you after
wearing heels for this long.

780
00:43:51,706 --> 00:43:54,053
It was the best we could do.
They're Allison's. Sorry.

781
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:56,918
Oh. Okay, well, thank you.

782
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:58,817
Here, oh, I got you cheese.

783
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,715
Oh, my God.You got to stay hydrated.

784
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:02,786
Thank you so much.They didn't have
glass bottles,

785
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,892
so we'll definitely
hold onto it and recycle.

786
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,175
Okay, so what we need to do
is find a phone, we need
to call the authorities,

787
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:15,178
and we need to wait here
until somebody comes
and rescues us.

788
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:18,802
Uh... This...
This is the rescue.

789
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,183
No one else is coming.

790
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:22,254
I'm sorry?I'm the rescue.

791
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:25,291
It was originally just
gonna be me, then I was like,
Trainer should come.

792
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:27,121
Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace.

793
00:44:27,224 --> 00:44:31,470
So, our best bet
is to get to the airport.
See this road right here?

794
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:34,266
From this area,
just take a shortcut
through the jungle to the road.

795
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:36,268
Did you just say "shortcut
through the jungle"?

796
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:37,890
Yeah.Okay, do you see us?

797
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:40,513
Uh-huh.You are not Dash,
and I'm not Lovemore. Okay?

798
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:42,032
I'm Loretta, and you are Alan.

799
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:44,448
And jungles
eat people like us, okay?Eat people.

800
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:47,866
And I don't want to mess up
the jumpsuit. It's on loan.
So we're gonna stay put.

801
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:49,902
We're not just gonna
stand around here, okay?

802
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:51,386
We're gonna go
through the jungle,

803
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,595
we're gonna go to the airport
and find a phone,

804
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:56,702
-so you can have your cake
and get what you want.
-"And eat it too"?

805
00:44:56,806 --> 00:44:59,256
If that's what you want to do
with your cake, fine. Let's go.

806
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,293
-That's the only thing you do
with cake.
-Not mine.

807
00:45:01,396 --> 00:45:03,847
I don't know
what your people do,
but my people eat it.

808
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,160
You could give it
to someone as a gift.

809
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:08,472
Those people
are still going to eat the cake.

810
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:10,129
Everybody eats cake.

811
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,062
What about the kind
people jump out of?

812
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:15,100
They don't eat it,
when they're in it.Oh, my God.

813
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:42,990
What did they
kidnap you for anyhow?

814
00:45:43,093 --> 00:45:44,957
Is it some weird sex stuff
like Taken?

815
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:46,614
Oh, my God, thank you.

816
00:45:46,717 --> 00:45:49,444
I thought so too,
but the guy's one
of the Fairfaxes.

817
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:51,377
Beverly?No, the older one.

818
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:54,933
The really odd one
that had the vlog
on finding Montezuma's treasure.

819
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:57,452
The dude that was on the news
for trying to raise the Titanic?

820
00:45:57,556 --> 00:45:59,351
Yes, he's looking for
the Crown of Fire.

821
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:03,424
Wait a minute. Like the actual
Crown of Fire? Like the one...

822
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,876
So those ruins were--They were
the Lost City of D, yes.

823
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:09,292
What?
Are you kidding me right now?Shh.

824
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:10,845
This is like your book.

825
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:13,779
So we're basically
on a Lovemore and Dash adventure
right now?

826
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:15,885
What is that?

827
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:18,473
What if Fairfax
actually finds the crown?

828
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:19,958
He won't. He won't.

829
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:23,237
Where do we go?Uh...

830
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,308
Oh, oh, oh.

831
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,520
Okay, uh, we need
to get in the water.

832
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:32,729
W-What?We need to go by river.

833
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,662
No, no,
I don't really do water.

834
00:46:34,765 --> 00:46:37,113
What do you mean, "do water"?
I'm not asking you
to procreate with it.

835
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:39,667
Uh, my body and water
don't really go together.

836
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,118
How do you feel about dying?
Oh, God.

837
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:44,085
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're okay. You're okay.

838
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:47,019
I got you. Fine.I can swim. I can swim.
Thank you very much.

839
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:49,194
Where are you going?I'm crossing.

840
00:46:49,297 --> 00:46:51,265
No, we have to stay
in the water.

841
00:46:51,368 --> 00:46:53,819
I researched
aquatic counter-tracking
for my book, A Year in the Bush.

842
00:46:53,923 --> 00:46:55,925
They'll lose our tracks
in the water.

843
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:58,824
Why is it warm here?
Wait, are you peeing?

844
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:00,930
Just go around it.

845
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:31,236
Okay, I think...

846
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,238
I think
we lost them, right?

847
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:36,344
Yeah. That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.

848
00:47:36,448 --> 00:47:38,105
Okay, uh...

849
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:40,624
Don't panic.What do you mean, don't panic?

850
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:41,936
-Just don't panic.
-No.

851
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,800
Stop saying "panic."
I'm panicking now.

852
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:45,767
You have something
on your back.

853
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:48,080
No!

854
00:47:48,184 --> 00:47:49,668
Stop screaming.What is that?

855
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:51,014
What is that?Stop screaming.

856
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,567
Do you have any on you?No. No.

857
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:54,121
Why don't you have any
on you?

858
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:56,019
Maybe the jumpsuit
scared them off.
I don't know.

859
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,641
Get 'em off.Oh, my God.

860
00:47:57,745 --> 00:48:00,265
Okay. No, I can't touch
those blood-gorged mucous sacks.

861
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:01,818
Can you fling it?Right now.

862
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,302
Get it.Just pick it
and fling it.

863
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:05,304
Just pick it and fling it.You pick it and fling it!

864
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:07,479
Can you spin it off?Please, get it off.

865
00:48:07,582 --> 00:48:09,619
I don't like touching it.
I'm feeling faint.

866
00:48:09,722 --> 00:48:12,829
They're sucking my soul out.Okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop.

867
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:16,729
Don't make that sound.

868
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,803
How many of them are there?

869
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:23,426
Oh, there's not many.

870
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,531
It feels like there's so many.What are you--

871
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:26,947
I feel so many.Oh!

872
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,604
Holy mother of God!Why are you praying?

873
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,745
Is it that bad?
It can't be that bad.
Is it that bad? How many?

874
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,092
It's not great.

875
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:35,852
They're gonna suck
every bit of me out.

876
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,613
Just please stop speaking.
I just need to--
need to get low.

877
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:40,443
Hold on a second.

878
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:43,342
Oh, God! I can feel them
just-- they're just
sucking out so much.

879
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:46,311
I'm gonna be like
a shriveled-up skin sack
when they're done.

880
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:48,382
You cannot tell my dad
I died this way, okay?

881
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:52,524
You gotta tell him
I was wrestling an anaconda
with a sword or something.

882
00:48:52,627 --> 00:48:55,423
I'm like a blood Jamba Juice.
They're just sucking it all out.

883
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:57,149
Why are they all
on my butt though?

884
00:48:57,253 --> 00:48:59,876
Kind of like picking anchovies
off my Caesar salad.

885
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,705
-It's actually not so bad.
-Anchovies?

886
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:03,397
Why do you go to food
right now?

887
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,365
Just find the queen,
and let's be done with this.

888
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:08,816
Think you're good.
I need to just check your front.

889
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:11,163
Okay. I can't look.

890
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:14,718
Is it bad?

891
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:17,928
Uh, wow.What is it? Just say it.

892
00:49:18,032 --> 00:49:21,380
I mean, you expect it to,
you know, not...

893
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:24,211
Then suddenly there it is,
and it is, uh...

894
00:49:24,314 --> 00:49:26,558
You know, you get excited
for a person.What?

895
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:29,285
I mean,
I'm excited for all people.Why are you excited?

896
00:49:29,388 --> 00:49:31,701
Well, you know, people
wonder, they wonder,

897
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:33,427
but they don't know, right?

898
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,016
They don't,
until suddenly they do know,

899
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,434
and then they--
they know something
that wasn't known before.

900
00:49:40,537 --> 00:49:42,401
Just--
Do I have any leeches or not?

901
00:49:42,505 --> 00:49:46,612
Oh, your plucky warrior hangs
in tranquil solitude.

902
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:47,820
What?

903
00:49:47,924 --> 00:49:50,064
No, you're good.
You're good.

904
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:52,929
We were so brave just then.

905
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,276
Why do they go for the butt
so much?

906
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:19,438
What's that song
you're singing?

907
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:22,545
A song
my abbiused to sing to me
when I was a kid.

908
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:26,169
"If you suck life
from the island...Yeah?

909
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,069
...the island
will suck of you."

910
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:33,107
Your grandma sang you songs
about getting sucked off
by an island?

911
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:35,558
It doesn't translate
super well.

912
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:39,286
Is phantom leech syndrome,
like, a thing?

913
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:41,391
They don't lay eggs,
do they?

914
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:31,717
Queen Taha?

915
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:49,701
"King Kalaman
and his treasure laid to rest...

916
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:54,292
laid to rest
in the well of endless tears.

917
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:56,328
Laid to rest in
the well of endless tears."

918
00:51:56,432 --> 00:51:58,296
What does that mean?Loretta!

919
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:00,712
You gave me
a heart attack.

920
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:03,059
Where'd you go?

921
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:08,685
What is this?

922
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:12,033
I'm not sure,
but maybe they gathered here?

923
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:17,246
Can you imagine
being right here,

924
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:20,007
right in this very spot
back then?

925
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,836
The stories
that they told?

926
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,701
So much history I'm sure
happened right here.

927
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,398
They've got us cornered.

928
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:33,193
Okay. We've got to go up.
Come on.What?

929
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:36,403
Have you seen what I'm wearing?
I'm in a glitter straitjacket.

930
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:39,475
There's nowhere to go but up.
Come on. Let's go.

931
00:52:39,578 --> 00:52:43,133
Oh! I should not be doing this.
I'm too old for this.

932
00:52:43,237 --> 00:52:44,342
No, you're not.
You're beautiful.

933
00:52:44,445 --> 00:52:46,102
I didn't say I'm not beautiful.

934
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,104
I said I'm too old
to be doing this.

935
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,832
My skill is sitting and thinking
and eating when I can't think.

936
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,352
Yeah, you definitely
could be wearing
better shoes for this.

937
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:56,354
You brought me
these shoes.

938
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:59,011
I can't go any further.
I can't go any further.

939
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:00,841
I'm not doing
so great here.

940
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,360
You got it. Come on.

941
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:04,327
I know you think
that you're safer holding on,

942
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,708
but you have to keep going.

943
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,710
I can't. I can't, I can't.Okay?

944
00:53:08,504 --> 00:53:09,953
Do you smell that?Smell what?

945
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:11,817
I smell something.Is it a predator?
What is it?

946
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,854
A downward cascading fire?You got to smell deeper.

947
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,131
I don't smell anything!

948
00:53:18,548 --> 00:53:21,793
Take a big, deep breath.

949
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,208
All right.

950
00:53:23,312 --> 00:53:24,934
Good job.Okay.

951
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:28,662
That was manipulative.
Thank you.Yeah, it was.

952
00:53:28,765 --> 00:53:31,251
Here we go. I'm gonna
help you out a little bit,
all right?

953
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,425
-One, two, three... Here we go!
-What are you doing?

954
00:53:33,529 --> 00:53:34,909
Get out of there.Come on.

955
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:37,084
No, no, don't flex.That's my hoo-hoo.

956
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:40,121
Just ride the head.
Keep the hands moving
and ride the head.

957
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:41,537
Oh, God.You're doing great.

958
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,298
Sorry about
the scratchy haircut.
Come on.

959
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:06,631
Dulcius ex asperis.

960
00:54:07,217 --> 00:54:08,598
What was that?

961
00:54:08,702 --> 00:54:10,220
Oh, nothing.

962
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:12,568
It was just something
that John and I would say

963
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:15,812
after we finished
something big, like a...

964
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,883
like an archaeological dig
or a manuscript.

965
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:21,301
It's Latin. It means
"sweeter after difficulty."

966
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,820
What's...

967
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:25,857
What's Latin
for "Loretta's a badass"?

968
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,448
I am a badass.
I climbed a mountain.

969
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:33,520
Oh, my God. I wish Beth
could've seen us do this.

970
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:36,454
Oh, God. Beth.Don't worry about Beth.

971
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:40,043
She's probably got
the whole navy
after us right now.

972
00:54:40,147 --> 00:54:43,219
I get that you think
you have to go to the island
authorities yourself,

973
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:46,740
but don't worry, I'm keeping
Loretta's socials super active.

974
00:54:46,843 --> 00:54:49,225
Just tweeted,
"Did I just get kidnapped?

975
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:52,849
#FML, @ShawnMendes,
#ShawnMendes."

976
00:54:52,953 --> 00:54:54,610
And you're traveling alone?

977
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:57,544
Yes, I'm traveling alone.
Mm-hmm. I'm single.

978
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,339
Then this might work.

979
00:54:59,442 --> 00:55:01,271
Okay! Talk to me.You'll hit New York.

980
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,896
From there, you'll fly
to Guinea, where you can
pick up a puddle jumper.

981
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:06,069
A what?

982
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:08,486
Small plane.Yeah, no leg room.

983
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:09,763
That's fine. I'll take it.

984
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:11,903
Or you could just come home.Thank you.

985
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:22,258
We need something
more flammable.
Everything is just so wet.

986
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,880
What's in here?
What's in your bag?

987
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:25,848
Uh...Oh, a lot. Okay.

988
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,401
What are you doing?

989
00:55:27,505 --> 00:55:29,369
Okay. Face masks.

990
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:30,887
Yeah, that was like
a gift-basket thing.

991
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,958
You brought a scented candle
into the jungle?

992
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:34,339
My mom gave me that.

993
00:55:34,443 --> 00:55:35,996
It was like a weird gift
for Mother's Day.

994
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,378
Your mom gives you gifts
for Mother's Day?

995
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:40,483
Noir--

996
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,554
Eucalyptus rosemary oil.
Ooh.

997
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:44,418
Oh, that smells good.

998
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:46,696
Um-- Oh, okay. All right.

999
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,422
Whoo! Yes!

1000
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:50,976
Yes, I made fire!

1001
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,635
-That's pretty impressive.
You have to--
-It is a beautiful fire.

1002
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:56,672
Who would have thought?

1003
00:55:56,775 --> 00:55:59,260
Oh, you're just, um,
taking your shirt off?

1004
00:56:00,365 --> 00:56:02,402
That looks
really uncomfortable.

1005
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:04,404
Are you okay? The back?

1006
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:08,580
Yeah. That is why
I don't do water.

1007
00:56:08,684 --> 00:56:10,962
Okay.My body becomes
an eighth-grader's face.

1008
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:13,930
Do you have anything for it?
Like some ointment or something?

1009
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:15,932
Yeah, I do. Well, I did.

1010
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:18,107
It was in a little,
tiny little bottle.

1011
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,178
It was this. I'm sorry.

1012
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:22,318
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1013
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,768
It's okay.

1014
00:56:23,871 --> 00:56:26,184
-Hold on. Yes.
Come here. Come here.
-What?

1015
00:56:26,287 --> 00:56:28,704
-Come here. Sit down.
-Let me see.

1016
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:30,291
Just sit down.Right here?

1017
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:31,603
Yeah.

1018
00:56:32,811 --> 00:56:34,434
Okay.

1019
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,401
Oh, no,
you don't have to touch it.
It's okay. It's fine.

1020
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:38,507
I touched
your engorged sacks, so...

1021
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:42,442
The leeches.Oh, okay.

1022
00:56:42,545 --> 00:56:45,341
Okay, this might be
a little bit cold.

1023
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,240
Sorry.Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1024
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:49,621
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1025
00:56:49,725 --> 00:56:51,692
Maybe this is how
Dash should die.

1026
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:54,833
Horrible eczema outbreak.
That's so sexy.

1027
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:56,456
I could make it work.

1028
00:56:56,904 --> 00:56:57,940
Yeah?

1029
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:00,045
All right, then.

1030
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:03,048
How would you write this?

1031
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:04,636
Okay.

1032
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:09,848
"Warmed
by the fragrant fire..."

1033
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:12,402
Mm-hmm.

1034
00:57:12,506 --> 00:57:14,404
Starting strong.Mm-hmm.

1035
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:17,615
"Lovemore's hands
explored the...

1036
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:21,860
the contoured scenery

1037
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:23,552
of Dash's body.

1038
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,384
Familiar terrain made

1039
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,835
new and exciting
with every...

1040
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:34,114
with every scarlet rim."

1041
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,910
And that didn't, uh...

1042
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:39,257
didn't turn her off?

1043
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,569
No.

1044
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:43,226
"Because with every
cardinal ridge,

1045
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,644
Lovemore discovered
another letter in the language

1046
00:57:46,747 --> 00:57:48,853
that only their bodies spoke."

1047
00:57:49,888 --> 00:57:51,925
And what were
their bodies saying?

1048
00:57:53,892 --> 00:57:55,445
"Take me...

1049
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:58,966
take me,

1050
00:57:59,553 --> 00:58:01,244
take me."

1051
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:02,660
How's that?

1052
00:58:03,488 --> 00:58:04,765
It was good.

1053
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:06,595
Your back.
I mean, how is your back?Good.

1054
00:58:06,698 --> 00:58:08,113
Okay. You sure?Yeah.

1055
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:12,773
I also meant my back.
Right there, yeah.Okay.

1056
00:58:21,023 --> 00:58:22,058
Supplies.

1057
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:28,478
Okay, I'm chilly. I think
I'm gonna probably turn in
in a little bit.

1058
00:58:28,582 --> 00:58:29,790
Okay.You good?

1059
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:32,552
Yeah, I'm fire-- fine.
I'm fine.

1060
00:58:32,655 --> 00:58:35,589
I'm not "fire."
I'm fine by the fire.

1061
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,005
Okay. All right.

1062
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,223
Uh, it's up to you,
but if you're cold,

1063
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:53,538
maybe we could probably
both fit in here,
if you wanted to.

1064
00:58:54,194 --> 00:58:55,920
Both of us?

1065
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:59,061
Only if you want to.
I mean, it's just--Yeah, no, that sounds...

1066
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,649
Uh...

1067
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:02,133
Okay. How do you...

1068
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:04,204
You can go first,
then I'll figure it out.

1069
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:07,448
No, no, you go.
It's definitely a "ladies first"
type of situation.

1070
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:10,210
Keep hands out of the bag
at all times.That's what I was gonna do.

1071
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,970
Butt to butt.Hands out and butt to butt.

1072
00:59:12,074 --> 00:59:15,387
Yeah. What do I do?Just get in. Go ahead and sit.

1073
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:18,183
I sit first?
Okay. I'm in.

1074
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:22,325
You're too heavy.
You're gonna flip this thing
like a cruise ship.

1075
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:25,087
You watch yourself.
Hold on. I'm not in.

1076
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,366
Why is this engaging
my core so much?

1077
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,058
How 'bout you shimmy?

1078
00:59:31,162 --> 00:59:33,267
I can't breathe.
I'm not breathing.Are you good?

1079
00:59:33,371 --> 00:59:34,683
My face.

1080
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:36,512
Yeah. Okay.

1081
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:41,103
Hands are out. Butt to butt.

1082
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:42,242
Okay.

1083
01:00:13,445 --> 01:00:15,033
Well!

1084
01:00:15,137 --> 01:00:16,276
Come on.

1085
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,036
Come on! Let's hear it!

1086
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,626
Let's give
a nice round of applause
to Loretta!

1087
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,352
She earned it.

1088
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:27,321
A geriatric shut-in
left you holding your dicks
in the jungle.

1089
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:28,806
Good job, Loretta.

1090
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:31,429
Boss, come on.
People are dying now.

1091
01:00:31,532 --> 01:00:35,191
Don't you think that maybe
this has all gone too far?

1092
01:00:36,434 --> 01:00:38,160
Is it really worth it?

1093
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:41,646
I am on the cusp
of attaining the unattainable.

1094
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,753
Something singular,
something no nation,

1095
01:00:44,856 --> 01:00:48,446
no emperor,
no brownnosing brothers
ever have.

1096
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:51,656
The legendary Crown of Fire.

1097
01:00:52,105 --> 01:00:53,244
So, yes.

1098
01:00:53,347 --> 01:00:55,660
Yes, I would definitely say
it's worth it.

1099
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:06,913
Excuse me!

1100
01:01:07,016 --> 01:01:09,916
Excuse me, sir. I need to get
to my next connecting flight.

1101
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:11,365
No flight.

1102
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:14,058
The pilot is sick.
Come tomorrow.

1103
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:16,301
No, no, sir.
I cannot come tomorrow.
I need to do this today.

1104
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:21,134
I need to get to the island
Isla Hundida tonight.
Lives are at stake.

1105
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:22,722
Come tomorrow.

1106
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:28,244
Excuse me, miss?Yes?

1107
01:01:28,348 --> 01:01:32,421
I couldn't help but overhear
you say that you like steak.

1108
01:01:32,524 --> 01:01:35,804
Okay, this is
a little bit crazy,

1109
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:37,702
but I also like steak.

1110
01:01:37,806 --> 01:01:40,153
What?I also like steak.

1111
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:43,708
Would you like to, maybe,
I don't know...

1112
01:01:43,812 --> 01:01:46,642
-Maybe there's a--
-No. "Lives are at stake."

1113
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,506
I need to go
to the island tonight.

1114
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:50,025
Ah.Yes.

1115
01:01:50,128 --> 01:01:51,716
Even more serious.Extremely.

1116
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,823
Well, I believe
that I may be able
to assist you.

1117
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:56,859
I have a cargo plane.

1118
01:01:58,033 --> 01:02:01,726
Maybe after I make my delivery,
we could swing by your island.

1119
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,625
I'm about to ask you something,
and you better
tell me the truth.

1120
01:02:04,729 --> 01:02:06,593
Have you ever
murdered anyone before?

1121
01:02:06,696 --> 01:02:09,941
No!

1122
01:02:13,531 --> 01:02:16,258
I don't know if I really buy it,
but let me tell you something.

1123
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:20,607
If you ever think about
murdering me, I promise,
I will murder you first.

1124
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,057
My pleasure.

1125
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,300
You are weird. Let's go.

1126
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,118
"King Kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well

1127
01:03:23,773 --> 01:03:25,189
of endless tears."

1128
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,054
What is that?

1129
01:03:29,227 --> 01:03:32,679
Oh, it's a-- it's a thing.
I mean, it's not, uh...

1130
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:35,026
You know, it's not
what you think it is.

1131
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:38,927
So it's not Fairfax's fragment
of an ancient parchment?

1132
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:42,827
Okay.
It's what you think it is.

1133
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:44,380
Loretta, I thought
you were smarter than that.

1134
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:47,280
Fairfax is never
gonna stop hunting us now.

1135
01:03:47,383 --> 01:03:48,384
What were you thinking?

1136
01:03:48,488 --> 01:03:50,455
We have a volcano
that could bury the tomb

1137
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,114
before we get to it,
before we see it,
before we preserve its memory.

1138
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:56,151
This is--I'm sorry.
Is that what we're doing?

1139
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:58,774
'Cause no one told me.
When were you gonna tell me?

1140
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:00,293
Why would I tell you?

1141
01:04:00,396 --> 01:04:02,226
We're in this together.
I came here to rescue you.

1142
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:04,021
You know you're not Dash,
right?

1143
01:04:04,124 --> 01:04:06,368
You don't ride in
on a white horse
to rescue people.

1144
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:10,751
You... spray yourself
with bronzer and you stand
in front of wind machines,

1145
01:04:10,855 --> 01:04:12,374
which is great for you.

1146
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:15,135
How would you have any idea
what I'm actually like?

1147
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:18,173
I know you. You're
a pretty open book, Alan.

1148
01:04:18,276 --> 01:04:20,071
-Okay, then who am I?
-Really?

1149
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:21,210
Yeah.

1150
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:25,490
O-- Okay, uh...

1151
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:28,700
You were a homecoming king
and you coasted
on your good looks to LA,

1152
01:04:28,804 --> 01:04:31,324
but then realized that being
the most handsome kid
in the middle of nowhere

1153
01:04:31,427 --> 01:04:33,153
doesn't mean
you're going to be a star.

1154
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:35,086
Until one day, when a woman
who couldn't publish her book

1155
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:38,779
on Spanish colonization
in the Atlantic decided
to write a romance novel,

1156
01:04:38,883 --> 01:04:40,816
uh, chose you at random
to be on the cover.

1157
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,337
Lucky for you and her,
the novels were
a smashing success.

1158
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,443
She kept writing her schlock,
you kept posing,

1159
01:04:47,547 --> 01:04:53,001
um, you know,
neither one of us becoming
who we'd hoped we would be.

1160
01:04:53,104 --> 01:04:57,212
Uh, and then one day,
we both die in the jungle

1161
01:04:57,315 --> 01:05:01,216
on one of those Atlantic islands
I wrote about
all those years ago.

1162
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:02,355
Right?

1163
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:05,013
Mm-hmm.

1164
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,026
It was Sarasota, by the way.

1165
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:20,131
It's not nowhere.

1166
01:05:20,235 --> 01:05:22,478
I grew up there with
my mom and two sisters.

1167
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:23,617
And yeah...

1168
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:27,311
I started modeling
'cause I wanted to get away.

1169
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:29,347
It was the only job
that I could think of

1170
01:05:29,451 --> 01:05:32,695
that could take me
to all of the places
that I always dreamed of going.

1171
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,111
Then finally to Los Angeles,

1172
01:05:34,214 --> 01:05:36,976
where I posed on the cover
of your romance novel.

1173
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:39,979
And I was so embarrassed
that one of my friends
might've seen me

1174
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:42,222
in that wig
on the cover of your book

1175
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:44,984
that I avoided talking to them
for months.

1176
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,434
And then one day,

1177
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,023
I'm walking home,

1178
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:52,922
and I hear this lady yell,
"Dash!"

1179
01:05:53,026 --> 01:05:55,546
She runs up,
and she is so happy.

1180
01:05:55,649 --> 01:05:59,412
Then I thought,
"How could I be this embarrassed

1181
01:05:59,515 --> 01:06:02,208
about something
that makes people this happy?"

1182
01:06:05,556 --> 01:06:07,247
Loretta, you can do
whatever you want.

1183
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:09,456
If you don't want to
write anymore,
don't write.

1184
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,047
But don't minimize the people
that love your work
by calling it schlock.

1185
01:06:14,151 --> 01:06:16,705
That's not fair to them.

1186
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:20,812
You know what's ironic?
I thought you of all people
would know

1187
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,367
not to judge a book
by its cover.

1188
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,029
Judge a book
by its cover model.

1189
01:07:01,508 --> 01:07:02,682
Alan?

1190
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,063
Alan.

1191
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,386
There's two of them.

1192
01:07:23,496 --> 01:07:26,188
Loretta! I'm over here!Alan!

1193
01:07:27,258 --> 01:07:30,330
Alan! Motorcycles and guns,
motorcycles and guns!

1194
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:32,574
Come on, this way!

1195
01:07:32,677 --> 01:07:34,300
Stop shooting!

1196
01:07:39,546 --> 01:07:41,514
Just give 'em the parchment!I can't.

1197
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:44,275
Yes, you can, actually.
You just say, "Here,"
and throw it at 'em.

1198
01:07:44,379 --> 01:07:46,691
Right. And then I'm sure
they'll happily let us go.

1199
01:07:46,795 --> 01:07:48,797
Okay, keep down.How do they keep finding us?

1200
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,386
You're basically
a walking disco ball.We need to come up with a plan.

1201
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:52,559
I have an idea.

1202
01:07:52,663 --> 01:07:54,113
We're gonna dig a hole,
throw our voices.

1203
01:07:54,216 --> 01:07:56,149
"We're over here."
Can you sound like a bird?

1204
01:07:56,253 --> 01:07:58,565
No, I have a plan.Alan, please, I'm thinking.

1205
01:07:58,669 --> 01:08:02,362
I know, but I have a plan.Please, just let me think
about...

1206
01:08:02,466 --> 01:08:06,090
Wait a minute.
They're shooting at you.Yeah, that's why we're hiding.

1207
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:08,506
No. No, no, no.
They're shooting only at you.

1208
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:11,130
They won't shoot me.
It's my brain that's valuable.

1209
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:15,099
What? I don't think
you actually hear the things
you say sometimes.

1210
01:08:15,203 --> 01:08:17,895
Maybe I can shield you.You are not shielding me.

1211
01:08:17,998 --> 01:08:20,242
I should be shielding you.Why? Because I'm a woman?

1212
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,418
That's supremely sexist.Well, look, I don't think
using women as human shields

1213
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:26,248
is exactly the change
that Gloria Seinfeld
had in mind, do you?

1214
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,182
Gloria Steinem?Whatever. Her too.
You know what? Fine.

1215
01:08:29,286 --> 01:08:32,358
Please mansplain sexism
to me right now.Oh, my God. I am a woman.

1216
01:08:32,461 --> 01:08:34,567
I can't mansplain anything.

1217
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:39,399
Uh, I'm a feminist,
and I think a woman can do
anything a man can do.

1218
01:08:39,503 --> 01:08:41,953
We just need to stay here
until they get tired.I have an idea.

1219
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:43,748
Please can I tell you
my plan?Alan!

1220
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:47,166
This is not a situation
you can get out of
by ripping your shirt off.

1221
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:49,202
Not my shirt.

1222
01:09:20,647 --> 01:09:21,959
Three!

1223
01:09:22,062 --> 01:09:23,650
-Yes!
-Oh!

1224
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:29,622
Oh.

1225
01:09:29,725 --> 01:09:32,970
That was different
than I had in my head.

1226
01:09:33,073 --> 01:09:37,146
I just wanted us to stop them.Could it have been the wind
that made it do that?

1227
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,356
No, I think it was us.
I think... we did it.

1228
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:41,875
We did the one guy, right?
But that was, like--

1229
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:45,327
We just wanted him to stop.
But I think the other guy
could've moved, really.

1230
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,571
So, that was--
that one was on him.

1231
01:09:47,674 --> 01:09:50,539
Even if we weren't here,
that could've happened.

1232
01:09:50,643 --> 01:09:52,369
Why are you gonna stop
next to a cliff?

1233
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:54,923
They were wearing helmets,
so maybe they're...

1234
01:09:55,026 --> 01:09:57,201
But the rest of their body
didn't have a helmet.

1235
01:09:57,305 --> 01:09:58,513
So there'd just be a head.

1236
01:09:58,616 --> 01:10:00,894
They were driving
recklessly, right?

1237
01:10:00,998 --> 01:10:02,724
Don't be mean on a bike.

1238
01:10:03,414 --> 01:10:05,174
Don't do mean stuff on a bike.

1239
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,215
I mean,
perhaps they're fine.

1240
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:13,735
Yeah, probably not.
But that's okay.

1241
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:18,118
That's all right.
You know, things happen.
Let's go.

1242
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:23,503
-You gonna put it back together?
-It's on loan.

1243
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:38,622
Look at me.Okay.

1244
01:10:39,519 --> 01:10:41,556
What more can I do,
you know?

1245
01:10:41,659 --> 01:10:43,592
You've done so much already,
Beth.

1246
01:10:43,696 --> 01:10:46,733
My poor, sweet, little Nana
has lost her sight.

1247
01:10:46,837 --> 01:10:49,564
The book release
is a complete disaster,

1248
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,324
which I've leveraged
everything on,

1249
01:10:51,428 --> 01:10:53,775
so I'm probably,
most definitely
broke right now.

1250
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:57,123
And most importantly,
I've lost a writer.

1251
01:10:57,226 --> 01:10:58,780
Who does that?
Who loses a writer?

1252
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:03,405
Okay, Beth, you remind me
of my best friend, Randy.

1253
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,994
Always looking out
for other people,

1254
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:08,445
never taking care of herself.

1255
01:11:09,446 --> 01:11:10,861
Isn't that right, Randy?

1256
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:15,244
She's like my therapist,
this one over here.

1257
01:11:15,348 --> 01:11:17,454
LOL. "Laughing Out Loud."

1258
01:11:17,557 --> 01:11:19,525
After you take care
of your friend,

1259
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:21,768
how about we go to a beach?

1260
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:24,357
What?Look, I have a pickup
in Hawaii.

1261
01:11:24,461 --> 01:11:26,428
She doesn't have to come.

1262
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,328
-Okay! Okay, you can come!

1263
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:31,433
She's hilarious.

1264
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:34,056
Let me ask you something.

1265
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,265
We're all sitting here
chitchatting,
but who's flying the plane?

1266
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:38,302
Autopilot.What?

1267
01:11:38,406 --> 01:11:41,132
Sir, go to the cockpit,
fly the plane.

1268
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:42,582
Okay.

1269
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:45,102
I'm going to
go land the plane.

1270
01:11:45,205 --> 01:11:46,655
Okay.

1271
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:48,657
No, no, no. Take the goat.
Please, take the goat.

1272
01:11:48,761 --> 01:11:51,419
She's on break.
Enjoy the flight!

1273
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,179
Hi.Hola.

1274
01:12:32,632 --> 01:12:35,324
This English dude came in
and basically kidnapped her.

1275
01:12:37,465 --> 01:12:40,778
Hey, it's Beth.
Please leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.

1276
01:12:40,882 --> 01:12:43,747
Uh, hi, Beth.

1277
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,851
It's me.

1278
01:12:44,955 --> 01:12:46,784
Uh, I'm alive!

1279
01:12:47,509 --> 01:12:49,546
Uh, listen, um...

1280
01:12:50,857 --> 01:12:51,893
Uh...

1281
01:12:53,342 --> 01:12:57,450
I'm sorry that I
blew up the book tour.

1282
01:12:57,554 --> 01:12:59,279
Um...

1283
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:01,765
I was just afraid

1284
01:13:02,904 --> 01:13:04,561
and selfish. Uh--

1285
01:13:04,664 --> 01:13:07,391
Oh, here comes Alan.
I'll call you back.

1286
01:13:10,567 --> 01:13:13,570
So, uh, police
are searching for Fairfax,

1287
01:13:13,673 --> 01:13:16,124
and they're gonna provide us
protection while we're here.

1288
01:13:16,227 --> 01:13:18,057
Did they say
how long we'd be here?

1289
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,818
They're gonna try to get us
on a puddle jumper
later this evening.

1290
01:13:20,922 --> 01:13:23,131
But, uh,
they said in the meantime,
the inn is really nice,

1291
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:25,823
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes.

1292
01:13:25,927 --> 01:13:27,342
Okay.

1293
01:13:30,794 --> 01:13:32,347
Okay. Yeah.

1294
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:26,574
Thank you.

1295
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:30,405
Come on.

1296
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:31,751
Dance with your husband.

1297
01:14:31,855 --> 01:14:33,650
No, no, no.He's not my husband.

1298
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:35,479
It's okay.Dance with him.

1299
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:38,068
No, no. She doesn't want to.
She doesn't have
the right shoes.

1300
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:40,691
Actually, it's the only thing
these shoes are right for.

1301
01:14:40,795 --> 01:14:43,038
You don't have to do this.

1302
01:14:43,142 --> 01:14:44,902
It's okay. It's okay.

1303
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,766
Yeah?

1304
01:16:05,396 --> 01:16:07,088
I wonder
what she's saying.

1305
01:16:09,469 --> 01:16:10,954
It's folklore.

1306
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:14,405
Love song about a woman

1307
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:17,823
whose lover died,
and she didn't want to
leave his side.

1308
01:16:18,858 --> 01:16:21,689
So she laid down
and refused to get up.

1309
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:24,036
Must be scary.

1310
01:16:24,139 --> 01:16:28,040
Having to face your future
without the person
that you planned it with.

1311
01:16:40,397 --> 01:16:41,950
What was that?

1312
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:47,749
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The, um-- the last line
that you sang.

1313
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,200
¿Quién llorará junto a mí?

1314
01:16:53,134 --> 01:16:55,964
"The island will weep for me
in the well of endless tears."

1315
01:16:56,068 --> 01:16:59,450
What is that,
the well of endless tears?
Is that a real place, or...

1316
01:16:59,554 --> 01:17:01,176
Sinkhole place.

1317
01:17:02,971 --> 01:17:04,697
Thank you. Gracias, gracias.

1318
01:17:04,801 --> 01:17:06,872
Come here, come here.What is it?

1319
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:10,323
Hey, on the parchment,
it said,

1320
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:14,500
"King Kalaman
and his treasure laid to rest
in the well of endless tears."

1321
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:16,709
I thought
maybe it was a metaphor.

1322
01:17:17,227 --> 01:17:18,780
It's not.

1323
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,749
The Well of Endless Tears
is a place.

1324
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:23,854
It's a sinkhole.

1325
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,132
There's a sinkhole
on the map.

1326
01:17:27,478 --> 01:17:29,239
I think the tomb is there.

1327
01:17:29,342 --> 01:17:31,724
This is so much better
than your books.What?

1328
01:17:31,828 --> 01:17:33,312
There's like--
No, I don't mean any offense.

1329
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,314
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.It's, like, equal.

1330
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,626
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.Look at you.
You want to go there.

1331
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,594
What? No.I can see. Yes, you do.

1332
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:42,804
That would be insane.
That would be insane.
I just-- I just--

1333
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:47,291
It's just that
we're so close to it,
but, you know, we can't--

1334
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:48,707
No.

1335
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:51,502
This is your story.
How do you want to write it?

1336
01:17:52,296 --> 01:17:54,609
I'd like to know
that it's there,

1337
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,369
that all this
meant something.

1338
01:17:56,473 --> 01:17:58,337
Okay. Then let's go.

1339
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,304
We'll stay one more day.
As soon as the sun's up,

1340
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:02,168
we're gonna go find
the Well of Endless Tears.

1341
01:18:02,272 --> 01:18:05,137
But what if it's nothing?So what? Then we say we tried.

1342
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,483
And Fairfax?

1343
01:18:06,586 --> 01:18:09,003
The cops are after Fairfax.
Don't worry about him.

1344
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:10,901
This is crazy.

1345
01:18:11,005 --> 01:18:12,696
Yeah, but look at you.What?

1346
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,768
It's the very first time
I've ever seen you
totally unafraid.

1347
01:18:16,389 --> 01:18:18,115
And alive.

1348
01:18:18,219 --> 01:18:20,739
I'm gonna go tell them
our plans have changed
and find us a ride.

1349
01:18:20,842 --> 01:18:22,292
Where are you going?

1350
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,022
I see you met
my friend here.

1351
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:32,509
He told me you were just
about to jump on a plane,

1352
01:18:32,612 --> 01:18:35,063
without so much as
saying goodbye.

1353
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:38,584
I said, "No way.
Not my Loretta.

1354
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:43,140
Not when she's the only one
who can lead me to the tomb."

1355
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:48,628
Stop squeezing so hard.

1356
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:52,253
Ow. Get your hands off of me!

1357
01:18:53,116 --> 01:18:54,980
Ow! Let go!

1358
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:56,671
I-I need a car.

1359
01:18:56,775 --> 01:18:58,707
A car, an auto.
Does anybody have an auto?

1360
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,269
No, no. No.

1361
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,305
I-I-I need an auto.

1362
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:11,755
I'll trade you my watch.

1363
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:13,274
It's a really expensive watch.
Do you have a car?

1364
01:19:13,377 --> 01:19:14,896
It's a Bulgari.
This thing glows in the dark.

1365
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,795
It's waterproof.I have motorcycle.

1366
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:32,155
Cool, isn't it?

1367
01:19:32,258 --> 01:19:35,365
I always thought,
why can't your personal tank
also have a minibar?

1368
01:19:35,468 --> 01:19:36,953
Have a drink.

1369
01:19:37,056 --> 01:19:38,609
Do you mind?

1370
01:19:38,713 --> 01:19:40,128
Uh, yes.

1371
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:42,372
He has a bit of a grudge
against you, I'm afraid.

1372
01:19:42,475 --> 01:19:45,271
Something about
a motorbike accident
his friends had?

1373
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,548
Why are you doing this?

1374
01:19:46,652 --> 01:19:48,412
I want something
nobody else has.

1375
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,139
When my father gifted--

1376
01:19:54,211 --> 01:19:55,730
As I was saying,

1377
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:58,767
when my father gifted
his empire

1378
01:19:58,871 --> 01:20:01,322
-to my baby brother--

1379
01:20:08,363 --> 01:20:09,882
Who is that?

1380
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:20,824
Is that a Ken doll
on a moped?

1381
01:20:21,618 --> 01:20:23,137
I know him from somewhere.

1382
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,897
Oh, I-I-I doubt that.

1383
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:27,210
Because what
you are looking at

1384
01:20:27,313 --> 01:20:30,213
is a highly trained
combat specialist,

1385
01:20:30,316 --> 01:20:33,906
forged in the furnaces
of Afghanistan, Iraq,

1386
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:36,598
Kuwait, Sa-- Sarasota...

1387
01:20:36,702 --> 01:20:38,773
Incredible skin.
No eczema problems.

1388
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:42,570
And he will not stop
until I am safe!

1389
01:20:42,673 --> 01:20:44,883
So you pull
this space tank over,

1390
01:20:44,986 --> 01:20:48,127
unless you would like to perish
like his friends did.

1391
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:51,648
And he is responsible
for their perishment.

1392
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:54,444
He might not have meant to,

1393
01:20:54,547 --> 01:20:57,826
but they... perished, so...

1394
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:14,015
Okay, who-who is this?

1395
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,017
I have seen him
somewhere before.

1396
01:21:18,502 --> 01:21:19,745
No, no, no.

1397
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:21,574
That's your cover model,
isn't it?

1398
01:21:21,678 --> 01:21:23,956
Yes. I knew
I knew him from somewhere.

1399
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:25,924
Get up there.

1400
01:21:26,027 --> 01:21:27,408
And kill him creatively.

1401
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:29,617
I love watching hunks fail.

1402
01:21:31,964 --> 01:21:34,208
I guess I-I will
have that drink.

1403
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:37,176
Oh, shit.

1404
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,834
Is it okay
if I just top 'er off?

1405
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:41,111
Yeah, that's fine, but--

1406
01:21:41,215 --> 01:21:43,182
Oh, my God,
have you used a glass before?

1407
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:44,632
Sorry.

1408
01:21:44,735 --> 01:21:46,220
What would
Jack Trainer do?

1409
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:49,499
It's hot in here.

1410
01:21:49,602 --> 01:21:52,605
Anyone else feeling
how hot it is?

1411
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:53,779
Are you trying to be sexy?

1412
01:21:53,882 --> 01:21:55,677
This is very weird.
Please, stop.

1413
01:21:55,781 --> 01:21:57,679
I could set your world
on fire.

1414
01:22:08,276 --> 01:22:10,589
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

1415
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,418
Go to sleep! Sleep!

1416
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:16,664
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1417
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:18,045
Time-out.

1418
01:22:18,148 --> 01:22:19,080
Time-in!

1419
01:22:24,913 --> 01:22:27,744
No! Don't shoot her!
I need her!

1420
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:31,265
Oh, Jesus!

1421
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:32,783
Ow, ow, ow.

1422
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:39,135
Move your foot! Move your foot!

1423
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,416
-Go to sleep, asshole.

1424
01:22:44,519 --> 01:22:46,176
Get out there! Look!

1425
01:22:50,767 --> 01:22:52,079
A bigger guy?

1426
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:53,390
Oh, no.

1427
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:55,979
What?

1428
01:22:58,464 --> 01:22:59,396
Move it!

1429
01:23:01,122 --> 01:23:03,435
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1430
01:23:04,332 --> 01:23:06,231
Hey! Get in.

1431
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:07,853
Him or me?

1432
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,758
This is not one of
your cheap, vapid
lady-fantasy books, Loretta.

1433
01:23:16,862 --> 01:23:18,829
This is real life.

1434
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,625
And we will kill him.

1435
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:23,455
Tell us where the tomb is.

1436
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:39,436
Hi.
So, whoever's in charge,

1437
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,163
I need you to send
officials to go here.

1438
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,371
Here.

1439
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,340
We are closed.

1440
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:47,789
You're closed?

1441
01:23:49,722 --> 01:23:52,829
You know I've been
trying to take a nap
for a year and a half?

1442
01:23:52,932 --> 01:23:54,486
A year and a half.

1443
01:23:55,418 --> 01:23:58,524
I have been burning the candle
at both ends,

1444
01:23:58,628 --> 01:23:59,974
the midnight oil,

1445
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:03,046
since way before
my friend got kidnapped.

1446
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,013
And all I want to do

1447
01:24:05,566 --> 01:24:07,706
is kick my feet back

1448
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:09,052
and drink some wine

1449
01:24:09,156 --> 01:24:11,537
that I'm probably
too tired to drink.

1450
01:24:11,641 --> 01:24:13,574
And I want a massage.

1451
01:24:13,677 --> 01:24:18,337
I want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet,

1452
01:24:18,441 --> 01:24:20,477
and I want it at the same time.

1453
01:24:20,581 --> 01:24:24,274
And I don't care if logistically
that doesn't make sense.

1454
01:24:24,378 --> 01:24:27,035
Because I have worked hard.

1455
01:24:27,898 --> 01:24:30,349
The same way that
I know that you have.

1456
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:33,456
So I hate to ask you

1457
01:24:33,559 --> 01:24:35,941
to leave this place open
a few more minutes,

1458
01:24:36,044 --> 01:24:37,977
because if we don't,

1459
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:41,636
a very close friend of mine
and her cover model

1460
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,500
are going to die.

1461
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,904
No good way in, boss!

1462
01:25:08,007 --> 01:25:10,148
What about the caves?

1463
01:25:10,907 --> 01:25:12,253
That's too dangerous!

1464
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,360
Well,
we'll be very careful then.

1465
01:25:28,925 --> 01:25:30,237
Well, come on!

1466
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:36,760
This way.I have a rule about

1467
01:25:36,864 --> 01:25:38,383
not going into
super creepy caves.

1468
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:52,673
Julian?
His name is Julian?

1469
01:25:52,776 --> 01:25:55,641
He seems more like
a Buck or a Bruce.

1470
01:25:55,745 --> 01:25:57,229
Lead the way.

1471
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,304
Go on. Don't be scared.

1472
01:26:33,058 --> 01:26:34,853
Watch your step there.

1473
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,130
Bruce!

1474
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:37,235
Julian. Oh, no!Julian!

1475
01:26:37,338 --> 01:26:38,960
Whoa.

1476
01:26:39,064 --> 01:26:40,583
Whoa.

1477
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:42,723
Well...

1478
01:26:43,551 --> 01:26:45,277
Let's not have
his death be in vain.

1479
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:48,142
-Onward and upward.
-What do you mean onward?

1480
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:50,696
We're not gonna go
and get him now, are we?

1481
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,215
Oh, man.

1482
01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:06,264
Okay.

1483
01:27:06,367 --> 01:27:09,059
Yeah. Look, let's just
go back to the boat.

1484
01:27:09,163 --> 01:27:11,027
This is over.
Nobody else has to die.

1485
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,305
No, no, no. Ha-ha!
It's a breeze.

1486
01:27:13,409 --> 01:27:15,859
There's a tunnel.
This could lead to the tomb.

1487
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:17,827
That's not person-sized.Ah, speak for yourself.

1488
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:20,208
Come on.
It's practically
a kiddie slide.

1489
01:27:20,312 --> 01:27:22,625
More like
a rock sphincter.Or a troll anus.

1490
01:27:22,728 --> 01:27:25,110
All right, well, you are
going through the anus--

1491
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:26,525
the hole-- the tunnel!

1492
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:28,631
Why her?You are our canary
in the coal mine.

1493
01:27:28,734 --> 01:27:30,149
No, that's impossible.
I can't.

1494
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:31,703
Please let us know
if you get through.

1495
01:27:31,806 --> 01:27:34,119
If we don't hear from you,
Fabio's got to die.

1496
01:27:34,222 --> 01:27:36,397
Wait,
I'm the damsel in distress?

1497
01:27:37,087 --> 01:27:38,330
It's okay. I'm fine.

1498
01:28:14,366 --> 01:28:16,817
I can't.
I'm so sorry. I can't.

1499
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,646
-Hey.
-What?

1500
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:21,339
Hey, you smell that?

1501
01:28:21,442 --> 01:28:24,376
You mean centuries
worth of bat feces?
Yes, I definitely smell that.

1502
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,689
You gotta take
a big breath for me.

1503
01:28:31,797 --> 01:28:33,178
There you go.

1504
01:28:33,281 --> 01:28:35,145
You can do it, Loretta.

1505
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,851
I think I see a way out.

1506
01:28:54,406 --> 01:28:56,615
Oh, cheese and rice!

1507
01:29:01,309 --> 01:29:02,656
I made it!

1508
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:04,243
I made it!

1509
01:29:04,347 --> 01:29:06,832
-See? Totally safe.

1510
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:08,903
Go on. Your turn.

1511
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,494
I'm coming through!
Be right there, okay?

1512
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,802
Why would they
build this here?

1513
01:30:20,906 --> 01:30:22,632
But how is anyone
supposed to worship

1514
01:30:22,736 --> 01:30:24,427
or remember you
if they can't even see it?

1515
01:30:24,531 --> 01:30:26,394
They aren't.

1516
01:30:26,498 --> 01:30:29,467
This isn't a monument
to Kalaman's power.

1517
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:33,160
It's a hiding place
for a grieving woman.

1518
01:30:33,263 --> 01:30:36,715
Taha came here
to be with her fallen lover.

1519
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:39,822
She just wanted
to be alone.

1520
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:42,997
Taha doesn't want us here.

1521
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:44,447
God, shut up, Rafi.

1522
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:46,414
It's just the volcano.

1523
01:30:48,071 --> 01:30:49,383
Come on.

1524
01:30:54,526 --> 01:30:56,183
We have to keep going.

1525
01:31:04,363 --> 01:31:06,020
All right.
Let's go, Muscles.

1526
01:31:06,814 --> 01:31:08,644
Open it up.

1527
01:31:08,747 --> 01:31:11,198
-Don't disturb them.
-She will be wearing
the headdress.

1528
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:13,890
Come on.
We didn't come all this way
just to pay our respects.

1529
01:31:13,994 --> 01:31:15,651
I can't, um...

1530
01:31:18,412 --> 01:31:20,621
Uh...I'm sorry, abuela.

1531
01:31:41,849 --> 01:31:43,161
What is that?

1532
01:31:45,301 --> 01:31:47,717
Are those... seashells?

1533
01:31:48,476 --> 01:31:51,341
The crown is made of seashells?

1534
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:52,998
Where's the treasure?

1535
01:31:53,999 --> 01:31:55,449
She's holding him.

1536
01:31:58,245 --> 01:32:00,005
You mean the dead guy?

1537
01:32:06,529 --> 01:32:07,737
Look.

1538
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:11,465
It's their courtship.

1539
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:15,469
Kalaman is searching the island
for something.

1540
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:19,887
Rare red seashells.

1541
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:24,996
To prove his love,
he gave her one shell
every day for a year

1542
01:32:25,099 --> 01:32:26,653
and made them into a crown,

1543
01:32:26,756 --> 01:32:29,552
bright red like
the flame of their love,

1544
01:32:29,656 --> 01:32:33,038
until the day came
where she accepted his proposal.

1545
01:32:33,142 --> 01:32:34,902
It was never about jewels.

1546
01:32:35,006 --> 01:32:38,734
Kalaman and Taha's riches
weren't material.

1547
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:42,600
It was their love.

1548
01:32:42,703 --> 01:32:45,050
That's what it meant.
That was enough.

1549
01:32:45,154 --> 01:32:46,362
So that's it?

1550
01:32:47,259 --> 01:32:50,159
All of that time
and money

1551
01:32:50,987 --> 01:32:54,577
spent on, what,
just a cheap metaphor?

1552
01:32:54,681 --> 01:32:57,476
It's a pretty rich metaphor.Oh, shut up!

1553
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,617
-We got to go. We got to go now.

1554
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:02,896
-Come on. Let's go.
-No, no, no.
You are staying here.

1555
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:05,070
You think it's all
so sweet and poetic.

1556
01:33:05,174 --> 01:33:07,659
Well, then you can stay here
and spend your last moments

1557
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:10,697
pondering the richness
of that metaphor.

1558
01:33:11,387 --> 01:33:13,665
-Get in.
-What? Come on, man.

1559
01:33:13,769 --> 01:33:16,219
-Oh, God. Just get in.
Get in the tomb.
-Okay, okay.

1560
01:33:16,323 --> 01:33:18,946
It's better
to be buried alive
than buried dead, I guess.

1561
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:22,329
-It's really not.
-You know, it is a shame,
really.

1562
01:33:22,432 --> 01:33:23,951
This is a hell of a story.

1563
01:33:24,055 --> 01:33:26,747
Pity you won't be around
to tell it. Come on.

1564
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,438
-But they'll die.
-So will you

1565
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:31,131
if you don't stop
being such a snowflake!
Get over here!

1566
01:33:40,727 --> 01:33:42,729
This is fine.
This is not an active nightmare

1567
01:33:42,832 --> 01:33:44,489
I've had since
I was 14 years old.

1568
01:33:47,837 --> 01:33:51,565
Why are you going so fast?
It's not a race.

1569
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:58,883
Wait, no! What are you doing?
Come back here!

1570
01:33:58,986 --> 01:34:03,681
You may have bought the island,
but now the island owns you!

1571
01:34:04,543 --> 01:34:06,028
You can't just
leave me here!

1572
01:34:08,064 --> 01:34:10,446
Rafi! Come back!

1573
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,036
I need a boat!

1574
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:25,564
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

1575
01:34:27,566 --> 01:34:29,430
Help! Help!

1576
01:34:29,534 --> 01:34:31,639
One of the locals
just stole my boat!

1577
01:34:31,743 --> 01:34:33,503
Have you seen a woman?

1578
01:34:33,607 --> 01:34:36,714
She's a brunette
in a sequined jumpsuit.

1579
01:34:36,817 --> 01:34:40,821
No. Is she in some sort
of trouble?

1580
01:34:52,488 --> 01:34:54,214
It's kind of funny.

1581
01:34:55,629 --> 01:34:57,424
I used to think this...

1582
01:34:57,527 --> 01:34:59,426
this sort of thing
was so romantic.

1583
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:00,910
Yeah?

1584
01:35:01,014 --> 01:35:04,362
Being locked in a coffin
about to be buried by lava,

1585
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:07,054
or... cuddling dead people?

1586
01:35:07,848 --> 01:35:10,920
Just laying down
with a lost love.

1587
01:35:11,024 --> 01:35:12,232
Like Taha did.

1588
01:35:14,786 --> 01:35:15,994
God.Oh...

1589
01:35:16,581 --> 01:35:17,962
Oh, God.

1590
01:35:18,065 --> 01:35:20,274
I'm sorry.

1591
01:35:20,378 --> 01:35:22,829
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you.

1592
01:35:22,932 --> 01:35:24,900
I'm sorry I couldn't be Dash.

1593
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:26,764
You're right.

1594
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:29,352
You're nothing like Dash.

1595
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:32,493
You didn't ride in
on a white horse
to save me.

1596
01:35:32,597 --> 01:35:37,982
You rode in on a...
borrowed scooter
with a broken muffler.

1597
01:35:39,362 --> 01:35:40,778
Yeah.

1598
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:43,781
I never could've written
a Dash like you.

1599
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,612
'Cause I never knew

1600
01:35:48,302 --> 01:35:50,097
a Dash like Alan.

1601
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:52,651
I was so afraid
of being hurt by life again

1602
01:35:52,755 --> 01:35:54,136
that I just stopped living.

1603
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,241
Couldn't see the good things
in front of me.

1604
01:35:56,345 --> 01:35:59,831
I'm just so sorry
I didn't see you sooner.

1605
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:02,523
I have a confession too.

1606
01:36:02,627 --> 01:36:06,527
See, I was really liking
where this new story of ours
was headed.

1607
01:36:06,631 --> 01:36:09,841
I just wanted to see how
it was gonna turn out, I guess.

1608
01:36:11,153 --> 01:36:13,707
The Adventures
of Loretta and Alan.

1609
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:17,745
No, it would need
a better title than that.

1610
01:36:17,849 --> 01:36:19,817
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

1611
01:36:20,956 --> 01:36:24,752
Sorry. Just...
Taha's femur is poking me.

1612
01:36:28,446 --> 01:36:30,206
Rafi must have
left that.

1613
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:32,830
How do you forget your crowbar?
It's gonna help us escape.

1614
01:36:32,933 --> 01:36:34,555
No, he left it
on purpose.

1615
01:36:34,659 --> 01:36:36,350
Oh, cool. I always liked him.

1616
01:36:36,454 --> 01:36:37,869
One...Okay.

1617
01:36:37,973 --> 01:36:39,802
...two, three!Okay.

1618
01:36:39,906 --> 01:36:43,841
I would've preferred him
to not leave us here
in the first place, but...

1619
01:36:44,531 --> 01:36:45,359
Okay.

1620
01:37:06,415 --> 01:37:08,624
Dulcius ex asperis.

1621
01:37:12,973 --> 01:37:14,872
Sweeter after difficulty.

1622
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:22,949
Go up!
Run for the trees!

1623
01:37:24,157 --> 01:37:27,056
Wait. Nope. Never mind.
Trees are on fire.

1624
01:37:27,505 --> 01:37:29,196
Okay.

1625
01:37:30,784 --> 01:37:32,648
We can go back
through the tunnel.

1626
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:34,892
Nope. Tunnel's a no-go.

1627
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,968
Um, okay.
I'm open to other ideas.

1628
01:37:42,071 --> 01:37:45,626
There's a current.
We can follow it into the ocean.

1629
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,352
How do we know
what's on the other side?

1630
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:48,940
We don't.

1631
01:37:50,769 --> 01:37:52,910
There's only one way
to find out.

1632
01:37:54,463 --> 01:37:56,120
Worth the rash.Yeah?

1633
01:38:17,106 --> 01:38:18,107
Alan?

1634
01:38:26,564 --> 01:38:27,806
Alan!

1635
01:39:05,258 --> 01:39:06,259
Alan?

1636
01:39:06,362 --> 01:39:09,055
A-- Alan?

1637
01:39:10,263 --> 01:39:11,264
Alan!

1638
01:39:14,543 --> 01:39:16,269
Oh, my God! You're alive!

1639
01:39:16,372 --> 01:39:18,616
I'm alive.Oh, my God.
I thought I killed you.

1640
01:39:21,584 --> 01:39:22,551
Is that Beth?

1641
01:39:22,654 --> 01:39:23,897
Loretta!

1642
01:39:24,518 --> 01:39:25,692
Beth!

1643
01:39:25,795 --> 01:39:27,452
Beth!

1644
01:39:27,556 --> 01:39:28,798
Beth!

1645
01:39:34,459 --> 01:39:35,840
Beth, you're here!

1646
01:39:36,496 --> 01:39:37,704
Why are you here?

1647
01:39:37,807 --> 01:39:40,603
I told you I got your back,
girl!

1648
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,985
I'm so sorry!

1649
01:39:43,089 --> 01:39:45,194
I destroyed
the jumpsuit!

1650
01:39:45,643 --> 01:39:46,644
What?

1651
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:49,267
Never mind! Later.

1652
01:39:49,371 --> 01:39:51,373
I found a British guy
in a cave.

1653
01:39:51,476 --> 01:39:53,961
I thought he was a little boy,
but he has a full beard.

1654
01:39:54,065 --> 01:39:57,344
Beth, that's Fairfax!
He kidnapped us!

1655
01:39:57,448 --> 01:40:00,209
He's a bad guy, Beth!
He killed my trainer!

1656
01:40:00,313 --> 01:40:01,314
Get him!

1657
01:40:01,831 --> 01:40:03,005
Stop him!

1658
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,050
I got your back, girl.

1659
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:17,157
Where were you running?
It's a boat.

1660
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:18,779
This guy's hilarious.

1661
01:40:18,883 --> 01:40:20,609
Got you.

1662
01:40:20,712 --> 01:40:21,989
Swim over to the rock!

1663
01:40:22,093 --> 01:40:24,164
I don't got you.
No, I got you.I got you.

1664
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:26,166
We're gonna get you.
It's gonna be okay.

1665
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,858
"Finding refuge
on a nearby rock,

1666
01:40:28,962 --> 01:40:31,068
he lifted her from the water,

1667
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:34,347
his powerful arms
pulling her body close.

1668
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:35,589
Alan whispered..."

1669
01:40:35,693 --> 01:40:38,247
Shh. You're safe now.

1670
01:40:40,663 --> 01:40:45,323
"In that moment,
Loretta could feel a new
adventure was just beginning."

1671
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,258
"The heart-pounding passion
of the narrow escape

1672
01:40:49,362 --> 01:40:52,296
only inflamed Loretta's
desire for him.

1673
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,610
She was thirsty for the hot lava
soon to be pulsing from his..."

1674
01:40:56,714 --> 01:41:00,304
Don't you go stopping
right at the good part.

1675
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:03,479
It's nothing she hasn't
read before.

1676
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:04,963
Didn't I tell you?

1677
01:41:05,067 --> 01:41:08,070
The most beautiful beach
in the world.

1678
01:41:08,174 --> 01:41:11,487
Maybe later, I'll show you
the Cove of Enchantment?

1679
01:41:11,591 --> 01:41:13,179
No, you can take Randy.

1680
01:41:13,282 --> 01:41:16,941
Remember, you are
my platonic man friend.

1681
01:41:17,044 --> 01:41:20,082
Platonic?
I like the sound of that.

1682
01:41:20,186 --> 01:41:22,843
Not sure what it means,
but I like the sound of it.

1683
01:41:22,947 --> 01:41:25,156
Here you go, Randy.

1684
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:29,229
My dear.You are an angel.
Thank you.

1685
01:41:29,885 --> 01:41:31,300
How did you know?

1686
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:46,004
Nice way to end
a book tour, right?Mm-hmm.

1687
01:41:46,557 --> 01:41:48,386
Um...

1688
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:52,735
You know,
I have a phrase I like to use
in moments like these, actually.

1689
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:54,081
Um...

1690
01:41:55,566 --> 01:41:56,981
Quid deinde?

1691
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:01,296
It's Latin.
It means, uh, "What's next?"

1692
01:42:03,194 --> 01:42:04,713
Quid cogitas?

1693
01:42:04,816 --> 01:42:06,197
Mmm.

1694
01:42:06,922 --> 01:42:08,095
Buca di Beppo.

1695
01:42:11,513 --> 01:42:13,170
Yeah. I know
zero other Latin.No. Yes.

1696
01:42:13,273 --> 01:42:16,207
I looked it up
for this moment right now.

1697
01:42:17,035 --> 01:42:19,176
So, what does come next?

1698
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:21,764
How would you write this?I don't know.

1699
01:42:21,868 --> 01:42:24,422
How would you write it?Do we really want me
to write this?

1700
01:42:24,526 --> 01:42:26,873
Just try. Take a stab at it.Okay. I'll write it.

1701
01:42:26,976 --> 01:42:28,323
Okay.

1702
01:42:28,426 --> 01:42:31,429
"We were-- They were, uh...
standing on a beach."

1703
01:42:31,533 --> 01:42:33,466
Sets the stage for the audience.
They know where we are.

1704
01:42:33,569 --> 01:42:35,364
You're already laughing.
Why are you laughing at me?

1705
01:42:35,468 --> 01:42:37,263
I'm not laughing.
I'm smiling.You are.

1706
01:42:37,366 --> 01:42:41,370
"There are palm trees
above a brown

1707
01:42:42,233 --> 01:42:44,856
bark-like hair
of the maiden.

1708
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,824
There is a dead jellyfish--"

1709
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:49,378
All you're doing
is describing what you're
actually seeing right now.

1710
01:42:49,482 --> 01:42:52,312
"He's nervous
because he really likes her."

1711
01:42:53,175 --> 01:42:55,212
It's nice writing.

1712
01:42:55,315 --> 01:42:56,627
Thanks.You're welcome.

1713
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,835
I'll keep going.

1714
01:42:57,938 --> 01:42:59,526
"He looked deep in her eyes.

1715
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:03,081
The only thing
that could compare
to the pulse of that ocean

1716
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:04,945
was the throbbing in the--"

1717
01:43:05,049 --> 01:43:08,155
Okay, no, you can't throb.Why not?

1718
01:43:08,259 --> 01:43:09,985
Can't come
out of the gate
with a throb.

1719
01:43:10,088 --> 01:43:12,401
You throb all the time.I don't come
out of the gate with it.

1720
01:43:12,505 --> 01:43:14,403
You have to earn the throb.Who made you
the queen of throb?

1721
01:43:14,507 --> 01:43:18,200
It's usually a chapter four
thing. You want it brought up
appropriately in four.

1722
01:43:18,304 --> 01:43:20,409
I think you throb
in all the chapters.
"Pulsating."

1723
01:43:20,513 --> 01:43:22,446
It's a precursor to throb.

1724
01:43:22,549 --> 01:43:24,655
"Undulating."You just jumped to five.

1725
01:43:24,758 --> 01:43:27,623
How 'bout they just kiss?
Why not?Just like a regular kiss?

1726
01:43:27,727 --> 01:43:29,591
Yeah. Like a
beginning-of-the-chapter kiss.

1727
01:43:29,694 --> 01:43:31,282
I'm good at starting--

1728
01:43:35,148 --> 01:43:36,632
How was that? Any notes?

1729
01:43:37,392 --> 01:43:40,774

first chapter attempt.

Psst.

Psst.

1765
01:45:13,695 --> 01:45:14,661
Mother--

1766
01:45:14,765 --> 01:45:16,491
You were dead.

1767
01:45:16,594 --> 01:45:19,459
Your brains came out
of your face and hit
the back of my throat.

1768
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:22,117
-He was in my mouth.
-Don't say he was in your mouth.

1769
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,843
-I could taste you.
-Don't ever say that.

1770
01:45:23,946 --> 01:45:29,124
We only use 10% of our brain,
so I just switched
to another 10%.

1771
01:45:29,227 --> 01:45:32,058
So, you're okay?

1772
01:45:32,161 --> 01:45:33,853
One hundred percent.

1773
01:45:33,956 --> 01:45:35,441
Meaning 10%.

1774
01:45:35,544 --> 01:45:37,304
We thought you were dead.

1775
01:45:37,408 --> 01:45:40,135
Naturally,
I have some anger issues
I need to let go of.

1776
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:42,586
Of course.And resentment.

1777
01:45:44,484 --> 01:45:45,830
So good to see you, man.

1778
01:45:45,934 --> 01:45:48,005
Okay,
let's keep the chatter down.

1779
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:52,492
We're closing our eyes
and reconnecting to our breath.

1780
01:45:53,562 --> 01:45:54,667
Great.

1781
01:45:55,495 --> 01:45:56,496
Great.
